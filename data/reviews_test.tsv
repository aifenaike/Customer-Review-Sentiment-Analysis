1	B001E5DZTS	A3SFPP61PJY61S	Not so goaty- which is Good!	Wonderful product! I began to use it for my daughter who was about to turn a year old. She took it with no problems! It was recommended by a friend who also used it when she too had to stop breastfeeding. Much better for a child in my eyes. I had tried a formula sample I had received in the mail- it left a greasy film in the bottle... gross. This does not! My daughter will drink it warm or cold- so easy for on the go as well. The canned was a bit harsh and she wasn't into it.. it tastes like a goat smells- this just has a suttle hint of goat. LoL	0	0

-1	B007M83302	A37JB1DGWBIDDS	Gross!	I just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received.  I ordered the variety pack and am very disappointed.  All flavors have a really weird taste to them, except for maybe the plain chips.  The salt and vinegar especially tasted gross!  I took one bite and had to throw the bag away.  Now I'm stuck with a bunch of chips that I'll never eat.	7	6
1	B000EDG4TE	A3PF4QT09KQV79	Bob's red mill pumkin seeds, Great product	This product is great tasting! I was eating the pepitas at half the price due to not finding USA made pumpkin seeds. The pepitas tasted bitter and were much larger.  I hope Red Mill continues to make their pumpkin seeds in the USA. It's worth the higher price for excellent quality and supporting local USA companies.	2	0

Read the blog on the topic of chicken dog treats made in China - [...]. After reading the many comments posted by dog owners who fed they dogs chicken treats made in China, I am discarding all of these treats and will seek an alternative product that is made in the USA.	2	1

-1	B000FFVYFA	A50PS6PW0AEPC	Taste good but...	"These bars are tasty. Recently, many brands of health bars have come out with chunks of fruits and nuts glued together with a sticky sweetener, such as aguave syrup, honey or evaporated cane juice. KIND Bars are not exceptional among these bars, and all of these types of snacks are very good in my experience.<br /><br />What makes KIND Bars different is that a portion of the profits is directed to the PeaceWorks Foundation, which is a charity that supports peace in the Middle East. By ""peace in the Middle East,"" they mean support for the ""Palestinian Resistance"" againgst the Israeli ""occupation."" This charity is considered centrist, and it rejects extremism, which it finds to be ineffective.<br /><br />Executive Manager of the PeaceWorks Foundation, Fathi Mohamed Hamdan Darwish, had this to say about the strategy of driving Israel into the Sea: ""That solution is unrealistic and ineffective and can't be realized. We as a Palestinian people have historically paid the price of hundreds of thousands of martyrs and injured people and haven't reached this solution."""	1	8

1	B001CGTN1I	A3KURTMF4YP4S2	Met my expections, hard to find locally (CAREFUL: THEY STICK IN TEETH!)	"It was always hard for me to buy this product locally - perhaps because it's so popular! I find these little chia seeds a good way to sneak in some extra nutrition and add some ""fill"" to my smoothies (otherwise all fruit + water or OJ). I've snuck them into other things too - oatmeal, salad, soups. If you add it to something wet, just note that the tiny seeds (think poppy seeds) will ""swell"" and turn a bit gummy. This isn't a big deal, but it changed the taste of my absolute favorite soup... so I don't think I'll try it in that one again (lentil). I drink my smoothies quick, so I add these as the last step, and I don't think they have much time to swell. The seeds themselves are pretty tasteless to me, just little black dots. WARNING: THEY WILL STICK IN YOUR TEETH! Seriously. These are an ""at home"" item only - when I can brush my teeth or swish well after. Don't try them at work, or before a big meeting, etc. Overall, I don't think they have changed my world... but a good little supplement/boost, and Amazon had them easy to get, and a great price compared to my local market. I took off a star because of the tooth concerns... but otherwise I wasn't expecting magic. They met my expectations and came fresh and well packaged."	0	0

-1	B004ZIER34	A2L6BT1PVV9YN0	Weak Aroma And Taste, Just OK	I obtained a sample and when I opened the package the aroma was not inviting at all.  Well, I brewed it up anyway on a regular Cuisinart coffee maker and used the sample bag with enough water for 2-3 cups to make a stronger cup of coffee. Nevertheless, it tasted weak to me and didn't smell any better after brewing it. It was drinkable and ok, just not very satisfying to me as it didn't have a richness or depth or good aroma to it. Admittedly, I am not a big French Roast fan as it tends to taste bitter to me and acidic.  This one may be better than other French Roast because while I thought it tasted weak and bitter it presumably is lower acid. If you need a low acid coffee, then this is okay, but if not you may not find this satisfying, especially if you like dark, full flavored strong coffee.	1	0

-1	B001LGGH40	A15U38AWJ3JDN5	Sweet, sugary soda	"Switch Kiwi Berry is a soda made from carbonated water and juice concentrates of Apple, Grape, Kiwi, Acerola, Raspberry, Strawberry and mysterious ""natural flavors"". At 135 calories per can, it's slightly higher in carbs than an average soda.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because although it is refreshingly free of high fructose corn syrup, it claims to be ""all natural"" -- not sure what's natural about juice concentrate. And, like regular soda, it is chock full of ""empty"" carbs -- like eating raw sugar. I get the feeling from the packaging we're supposed to think it's a healthier alternative, and this seems disengenious at best.<br /><br />It tastes OK, but really isn't anything special; it doesn't taste like kiwi fruit and only vaguely of strawberries."	1	0

-1	B000SSV9X6	AAEL8AM7VT1FK	Diappointed ! !	I was very diappointed in this product and the company selling this product!<br />First of all shipping of this product was grossly overstated and was not anywhere near its estimated delivery time(product was 3-4 days overdue). Second of all this product was advertised as(HOT & SPICEY)an this is an overstated claim , You can purchase Hotter & Spiceier chips locally that has more KICK than these!<br /><br />I(WOULD NOT) recommend this product or its (shipper) to Anyone!	0	0

Chicken and the S & B were cheap to buy in these days and we ate it a lot.<br /><br />I never thought those memories could be recreated through smell and taste again, but oh My godness it was!!<br />It is just a delicious as I remember it being as a kid. I bought a case of 8 and have 6 more left. I don't know why the stores don't have this in stock...one clerk said its the msg in it. Well people should be able to make there choices of buying it or not buying it.<br />I am still amazed at the granular style it is and how it ends up this red sticky delicious old style bbq sauce that sticks to it like glue.<br />It is so gooood!!

1	B001CGTN1I	A2V5R832QCSOMX	Healthy food at a good price	A friend of mine has been touting the benefits of chia seeds for years, so I finally decided to give them a try.  I really like them.<br /><br />I haven't tried making tapioca or pudding like some of the other reviewers have;  instead, I usually toss a tablespoon into my protein smoothies or into my granola/Greek yogurt/goji berry mixture.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, they do swell up after they've been in liquid for awhile, but I've found that as long as I drink my smoothie within 10 minutes or so of making it, it's fine.<br /><br />Since adding chia seeds, goji berries, and soy lecithin into my diet last month, I've noticed that my skin seems brighter and smoother, and I have more energy.	5	1

1	B003AO5DLO	A3BEO6VFOO8FRB	Great deal!	Royal Canin was recommended for my dog, but since this line of dog food is specific to breed, it was difficult to find in stores.  PetsMart and Petco carried the Cocker Spaniel formula but only in smaller bags which is much more expensive on a per ounce ratio.  Finding a larger bag has been a great deal.  My cocker loves the food too!	2	0
-1	B000BXUVYG	A3LAG0P9MC3B32	Throw up Treats	I finally did the research on this temptation treats and I'm glad to see that my suspicions are correct. I have been buying this treats for my kitty for years and suspected them all along to be the cause of him vomiting. Ironically, I even bought the hairball ones to see if they would make him stop vomiting. Now is official, I stopped giving them to him as often, and then monitored him whenever I gave him any. It soon became clear to me that he only vomits whenever I give him this treats. Sometimes he would vomit within minutes, and other times he would vomit during the night or the next morning, but if I give him this treats, I'm sure to be cleaning up orangee throw up off my carpet soon after.  I think is a matter of allergy or sensitivity to one of the ingredients, and they probably don't do anything to other cats but I'm never buying this again for my kitty.	2	0
-1	B004I1MYCE	AO25Q1RSYFT5J	Salty Dirt in a Bottle?	Sorry, but this isn't truffle salt.  I'm shocked that it's so bad.  All the truffle salts I've used have an excellent aroma that is garlicky and salty, a great addition to many dishes.  I was impressed with the reputation of Whittingtons, but what is this stuff?  If I mixed coarse salt with dirt from my backyard, this would be it.  Maybe I just don't know black truffles, but someone should have washed them first!  I'm sending this back and will get truffle salt at my local gourmet store that I can smell first.  I thought they'd all be fabulous at this price and on Amazon.	0	0
1	B006N3IG4K	A29NA3RIZT5CH8	YUMMO!  I am a coffee purist	This is great coffee.  I am a coffee purist.  I don't add cream or sugar (unless it is weak or bitter). I truly enjoy coffee.  I have tried many different types of coffee for K-cups.  This is my new favorite. The price was amazing too.  Very smooth and subtle hazelnut flavor, not overpowering.	0	0
-1	B003VXFK44	A3LQS08K2OBI5Z	"My mom said this was not as flavorful as other ""Extra Bolds"""	"This is the most USEFUL info you will ever need to know about K-Cups, and one that took me forever to discover:<br /><br />Bold/Extra Bold coffee in terms of k-cups does not mean that the coffee itself is stronger, it only means that they included more grind in the cups to provide you with a stronger coffee.<br /><br />There! Now you know.<br /><br />My mom goes for the Extra Bolds only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over 40 years now, and she's frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck (or rather mine, since I buy it for her).<br /><br />Unfortunately, out of all the Extra Bold k-cups she's tried, she claims that the Wolfgang Puck is the weakest tasting. She's tried it in both the medium & small serving sizes format, and both have produced less-than-full-flavor drinks.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rich, flavorful, strong-tasting coffee, try the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ7A"">Van Houtte Cafe Honduras Medium Roast, Extra Bold Coffee, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>."	1	0

-1	B004ZIER34	A3V6QSTG2T9MIO	I so wanted to love it... but I don't like the taste.	I was so excited to find this coffee. I do have acid reflux and I thought this would be great for people like myself. I regularly take Omeprazole. I was not expecting this coffee to do magic but at least not produce more acid. I don't really know if it works for people with acid reflux because I could not drink more than half a cup as it doesn't taste good at all. It's not like it is too strong to drink - in fact it's very light. But the taste is weird.<br /><br />Having said that, taste is a personal choice so some people may love it. Don't decide based on a review. If you're considering this, I strongly suggest trying it for yourself to see if you may like it.	0	0
-1	B000SATIGO	A3GB91FPW6E22A	Weak; little flavor	I decided to try this tea based on the description and reviews, but found it weak, with little flavor. For reference, I like my tea very strong and normally buy the Davidsonas English breakfast tea.	1	0
-1	B0001U4VK4	AHY4NQZ9B3M66	wedding pretzels	We purchased the pretzels to make chocolate covered wedding favors for our guests.

-1	B001VIY9KW	A2YUENB1IBXQH1	has corn in it	We fed this to our bulldog when she was a puppy, and at first she did wonderful. Then the corn and preservatives took their toll.... She was itching and had a chronic ear infection and her face had a terrible yeasty smell ALL the time. She licked her paws constantly and scratched her face raw on any surface she could find. Then she started vomiting. We HAD to change her food. Now she eats a fully carnivorous raw diet and is thriving! No more itching, no more ear infections, no more yeast, no more paw licking.	3	0
1	B006N3IG4K	A1PCB6OXKWKLBL	Great Cuppa...except	"Ok, now on our third box of Breakfast in Bed. We had become fans of Donut House and Coffee Shop, looking for that balanced smooth ""Dunkinesque"" brew. We found ourselves coming up just a bit short in the strength/flavor area. Corrections were made in brew size and eventually adding in a bit of Emeril's Bold or various dark roasts. Well problem solved with the B in B. Smooth and flavorful and a good eye-opener. (Was worried the name somehow implied less caffeine)Based on our experience in these areas, 5 stars. The ""except""? On three seperate occasions out of two boxes purchased seperately, we had ""exploding"" K-cups! A small pop during brewing that sent coffee grounds spewing over and in the Keurig, counter top, and coffee cup. This at our home brewer AND our vacation house. Messy. Very messy, requiring unplugging and careful cleaning inside cup holder and area. Minus 1 star. Umm, exactly who makes these things and where...hopefully a road bump on the way to sucess. Peace."	9	0
-1	B001T3GGXM	A1T12UDN6JVOEF	Goji Berries for weight loss?	"I read about these for weight loss among other benefits and thought I'd try them.  Make sure you know they are related to the tomato and chili pepper more than a normal ""berry"" because they taste more like a bit of dried tomato than a sweet fruit.  Easy to lose weight with them when they taste like dried tomato- make it your only available food :)"	0	0
1	B001LG945O	A25KVM6GJBLISZ	Flavor with fizz	It's very refreshing to find products without sugar added, but make no mistake, this tiny can still packs a solid 34 grams of sugar, enough to give you an energy rush followed by the typical adrenal fatigue crash.  Perhaps you can sip just a few ounces every few hours to avoid the crash?<br /><br />The flavor is very good and will tempt you to chug the whole can in one quick drink.  Not exactly a health drink, but it's a nice improvement over the usual junk sold as a soft drink.	0	0
-1	B003KV7V1C	A1N46TN133W0C7	Not as the label states	"Let me start by saying this is not really bad jerky.  I took issue to two of the descriptions on the bag.  The first is that this in my opinion is not ""HOT"".  One would thing that Habanero jerky would at least elicit some type of heat in the mouth, tears, etc.  I did not find that to be the case & was quite disapointed.  I also do not believe this jerky to be very ""tender"".  The first two pieces I ate almost have the consistency of shoe leather & were very tough to chew through.  I have had purchased more tender jerky at Dollar General.  I will not be buying this again."	0	0
-1	B00153SSZU	AWM2HDBOJLFKX	Causes vomiting	I like the idea of getting grains out of cat food, but using peas instead doesn't seem to be the answer.  Carnivores (at least my cat) doesn't tolerate peas.  Vomiting began in about 2-3 weeks and is now instantaneous.  Eat some cat food--go right to throwing up. Both chicken and salmon.  So for me it was a waste of money and very disappointing.	0	0

1	B000MIFPM8	A1R9QOPV6HVEKF	Great for lunch!	I've been a fan of this stuff for years.  Make sure you stir it up after you pull it out of the microwave since the grease seems to float to the top.  It is quick, easy, and makes for a tasty lunch when you are short on time or don't feel like going out for lunch.	2	0
-1	B00622CYVS	A8PP8NPRJSAKO	Not a fan of BPA in baby food jar lids	"As I have with all other Earth's Best jarred baby food, I won't be purchasing these Dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain BPA.  I contacted Earth's Best's consumer relations dept. personally, and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines Earth's Best baby food jar lids contains ""trace amounts"" of BPA, but it ""doesn't come into direct contact with the food.""  That kind of lukewarm response wasn't enough to put my concerns about BPA to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostled-around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids.  So I guess I'll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earth's Best rep did say that they were doing ""accelerated testing"" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).<br /><br />This is such a shame, because Earth's Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies & carbs/starch) in PUREE form.  All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ella's Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  Earth's Best does make some baby food in BPA-free squeeze pouches, but that doesn't include its Dinner line.  I was hoping to be able to expose my little-one to a wider variety of flavors and well-balanced meals while still at the puree stage.  But I guess I'll have to wait until she's old enough for Stage 3 chunky meals, or make her baby food myself.  (Virtually impossible for this super-busy and domestically-challenged mom, LOL!)"	2	0
-1	B003VXFK44	A3T4UQRGKU4SPG	Can't find the perfect Creme' Brûl&eacute;e Coffee!	10 years ago my daughter brought home Creme' Brulee' for the first time. It was perfect, beans to be ground.  Since then I have searched for ANYTHING similar. When I realized I couldn't find it, she had forgotten what one she purchased.<br /><br />This one has a strong flavor, but it tastes fake with a strong after taste. Unfortunately it is one of the better ones.  If anyone reads this and knows what ones (Carmel and Vanilla), taste great, please post here.	0	0
1	B003UDSXU8	A3UOSNSYF9F9PV	One of the best salsas!!	Nice combination of ingredients so that it is VERY hot, yet still has great flavor. It has a little added sugar, which adds a nice bit of sweetness to the mix. For the hotter salsas, you really can't go wrong with this. This is one of my top four favorites, which include Mrs. Renfros hot salsa, Screaming Sphincter and Pain is Good #37.	0	0
-1	B007JFMH96	A2XNOB1T796Y6B	Not something I'd get with my own money	I'd selected this without seeing that it had almonds in it (reading fail, I know) but I had a house full of critics to run this through.<br /><br />My mother ripped into the box before I even had a chance to ask her if she wanted one. She was actually somewhat disappointed, as this was exactly the type of thing she likes. She said that they're good, but that they're sort of mediocre as far as cookies go. My grandparents liked the cookies and would eat them, but it was clear that it was only because they're there.<br /><br />I do have an allergic reaction to tree nuts, but for the sake of the review I tried a tiny piece. (Don't worry, I took precautions and I felt I owed it to at least try the cookie myself..) It's pretty bland and while it smells really great and is very soft, those two things just didn't translate into a huge flavor situation.<br /><br />The general consensus was that while these were decent enough to eat, they're really not something anyone is overwhelmed by. The box has sat in the kitchen pantry for almost a month now and there's still half a box left, if that says anything to you. This is just a mediocre cookie. If my family had liked these then I'd have gladly bought some for them again (I love feeding them), but their reaction was so ambivalent that I don't think I'd get these on my own.	0	0

(Which is good -- she's the reason we had to seek out a new food that was for both adults and kittens.)  My older cat took a few weeks to adapt to the creamier texture, compared to her ""favorite"" canned food, although she loved the taste right away.  Once she got used to it, we started going through this case like it was going out of style and I had to buy more!  I have noticed much less smelly litter boxes since we got into this case, compared to many of the foods we use ... that was a big bonus for me, and enough to convince me to put this into our regular rotation of canned foods."	0	0
-1	B000EGX2EG	A2V0I904FH7ABY	Great taste - but honestly what goes inside ?  read on ...	I used to buy these as healthy snacks at my office cafeteria and consider it better than a bag of potato chips.  These taste very crunchy and tasty.<br /><br />Given the kind of unethical food stories we read about China - we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these.  You just cannot import food stuff and sell in the US as gourmet snack food - there needs to be data backing this.<br /><br />Few example of Chinese food (yuk ...):<br /><br />(1) Melamine(kind of platic) in baby food and milk (so wide spread that 80% of milk in China contained this plastic in 2008)<br /><br />(2) Honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin (antibiotic) - because of which it was banned in the US<br /><br />(3) Soy Sauce made from Human hair (not joking google it if you want)<br /><br />(4) Spurious drugs exported to African countries.<br /><br />Need some good facts and quality controls from the Manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls.	1	2

1	B0025ULYKI	A29BWC41573AF8	No more stale chips. Cheap!	Mine came with stickers to sell them for $1.59 but they cost more like $1.25 so if for retail that is not much of a mark up. I bought these for myself so that doesn't really matter and they are cheap. Similar to Lay's but cheaper. Unlike other knockoffs these seemed to taste fresher and the convenient size minimizes stale chips. Great product. Great price.	1	0
-1	B004ZIER34	A2FVD05Z2FYW1P	Just OK	I definitely noticed a difference in the way my stomach reacted to this coffee -- much less acid, fewer jitters. However, while the French Roast coffee tastes pretty good, there is a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste that is unpleasant. Overall, this is just OK.	0	0
-1	B0045TK2ZK	A6GKKTS24Q6V7	Horrible!	So disappointed with this frosting.  The first time I used this frosting I was disappointed, but a year has gone by and I thought that maybe I had gotten a bad container.  I really should have thought twice about buying it again, but I wanted to give Pillsbury the benefit of the doubt.  Boy was I wrong in doing that.  Both times that I used it, the frosting pretty much 'sagged' off of the cake!  My cakes were definitely cooled.  I had even put the latest one in the freezer to slice into layers.  After thawing it in the fridge, I began to ice it.  Sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake (again)!  This product needs to either be marketed as cupcake frosting, the recipe needs tweaked, or it needs to be pulled off of the shelves all together.  Shame on me for trying it a second time!	2	0
1	B000KOSDY6	ANLP3KC6PKDJC	Makes bringing a side dish a little easier	I've got no talent in the kitchen but in today's economy hosts really appreciate guests who contribute to the atmosphere by bringing a side dish.  I'd sampled this corn cake at a friends and couldn't believe it came from a mix.  I immediately ordered the mix from Amazon and put it to the test. So easy (water, melted butter and a cake pan) even I couldn't mess it up!! I took it to the next gathering where it was a hit.  I only wish it came in a smaller shipment (min. shipment is a pack of 12) but since everyone always seems to want the recipe, we can share.	0	0
-1	B000HALT80	A3PNN6W95O5XNV	"Kibble is not ""softer"""	I got this for my 12 year old cat who stopped eating his regular dry food, as the kibble was a little too hard for his teeth.  I ordered this because it was described as having soft kibble, but was just as hard and looked exactly the same as the Science Diet I had been feeding him.  He eagerly went for the food when presented, but stopped eating it after a few bites because it was too hard.  Luckily, I didn't buy a huge bag, as this food is expensive.	1	1
-1	B000084ETV	A2VZIJHABHMIQW	Canidae made my dogs VERY SICK	New food and or changed formula's need to be introduced to animals slowly. Very slowly. However, I was not given this option by Canidae when I ran out of the old All Stages Life Dry Dog Food and purchased a new bag of the new formula (no warning label) with none of the old to mix in. That is the problem I'm having with my four dogs, 2 of which are 12 years old. Granted, the changes may be an added benefit to their new formula but it's NOT a benefit if they don't notify their consumers that there has been quite an extensive change (19 additional items) to their recipe.  Meanwhile, I've had to deal with 4 dogs who have been vomiting and have bloody diarrhea as well as vet bills for the past 17 days because of Canidae's neglectful oversight on not informing their consumers. I just found out about the NEW formula 2 days ago while researching Canidae on the web and found more disgruntled consumers.  That is why I give them 1 star.  The one good thing I can say about Canidae (their old formula was great by the way) is thank God this can't be compared to the recall of last year that killed thousands of pets.  By the way, what WAS wrong with the old formula????	6	1

1	B001E5E29A	A172XQT2V9YUOR	Delicious but pricey.	This is a delicious recipe and ingredients and the one I use. A bit pricy but if you don't mind the price point it makes a wonderful waffle. Combine this with a Waring Waffle maker and you could be in Waffle Heaven.	8	0
-1	B004ZIER34	A2OW356OMJNAVH	Smooth though not robust dark roast	I like low acid coffees for the reduced bitterness, as I dont general have acid-induced stomach problems. This coffee was very smooth and had little to no bitter taste - great features of a dark roast.  However, the flavor was not as deep or rich as I would expect from a gourmet French roast. It was pleasant, but I prefer a slightly more robust, complex flavor in a dark roast.	0	0
-1	B00068PCTU	A1BRY47PU9CIX9	meh	Maybe my tastebuds are different but I bought this at a local healthfood store and I'm not completely sold on it.  I tried it in my tea and it did leave me w/ an aftertaste...just like most sweetners. *shrugs*	2	1

I saw these new ""Berry Burst Ice Cream"" Oreos and thought that I would give them a try.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but they are WAY too sweet.  On top of this they have a fake, overpowering ""berry burst"" flavor that's just not good.  I'm trying to eat a couple at a time, so I don't have to throw them away. . . but I really don't think I'm going to be able to finish the bag.  I've had them a week, and that's VERY unusual for me to have a bag of cookies that long."	1	0
1	B000UZVPKO	AH5PPU03O74GP	Roland Sardines are Healthy and Good	I buy skinless sardines packed in water to keep my intake of sodium and chloresterol down.  For about $2 a can including tax and delivery I feel I am getting my money's worth.  I cannot get these kinds of sardines at the local supermarket.<br /><br />Sardines are somewhat tasteless.  I put the sardines on salad and top the salad with olive oil and red wine vinegar.  If I eat the sardines as a sandwich, I used mustard, which also has no salt and chloresterol.	0	0
1	B0035Q0N0I	A3HPCRD9RX351S	Great Ingredients	Nature's Recipe is now a division of that mega company Del Monte Foods.<br /><br />The Test<br /><br />The neat thing about this food is that it really does look like the photograph on the bag. It consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in. When the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of Farm Selects unmixed and readily took to it. Since then they've been eating it mixed with their Blue food.<br /><br />I thought Evie and Piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there, but they don't specifically target the vegetables to leave behind.<br /><br />The quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list. Only one ingredient, that animal digest, makes me cringe a little. The girls don't mind it a bit. For goodness alone I can heartily recommend this natural food, but the price on it is relatively high. Rachel Ray's dry dog food, for example, is about half the price of Farm Stands Selects, and Buffalo Blue is about the same price. For a household like ours with three dogs, the Farm Stands Selects is too pricey  to feed the girls exclusively. We'd feel obliged to mix another good, but less expensive food with it. For those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue, I say you can't go wrong with Farm Selects.	2	0
1	B002SW7ZOW	A30YYMAI6NXWKM	Nice flavor, great value!	Not much else to say... I keep a box in my desk here at work, and I can enjoy a cup anytime!

-1	B001EQ5EQE	A1Q4UTBBDW6SAM	Decent	This decaf is OK.  It is a Medium Roast, not a dark roast (says it on the can, but not in the description here).  Also, unlike another reviewer, I think that it is ground very fine.	0	0

1	B000FFRY3G	ADMJ3LWWQSLER	Good but slightly expensive	"This product is very good but I have this feeling that it is rather highly priced.

I like the muffins particularly when they are toasted."	0	0
1	B004K30HO2	A2GXQISRQZKR8H	Disposable is great!	These DisposaKups work great.  I simply fill up a dozen or more with my favorite flavored coffee, and I'm good to go.  It's a great alternative to buying the expensive pre-filled K-cups; not only were the pre-filled K-cups expensive, but they don't offer my favorite coffee blends.  I was using the reusable K-cup filters which are quite expensive to purchase, so I only had 2 & they leaked while brewing & were messy to empty and wash to re-use.  The DisposaKups work much better--just as well as the pre-filled K-cups, no leaks, no mess!  And I can re-use them again if I want by throwing out the filter, rinsing, & using a fresh filter (just have to line up the holes).  Great product! I highly recommend it.  I love my coffee machine again.	1	0

1	B002BRC562	A2LR017WSA6ROW	Love these, but only got 11 of 12 packets.	When I opened the package, I only found 11 packets of the Honey Stingers. There should have been 12. I counted and re-counted 4 times to be sure. The packets were in a thin cardboard display box, wrapped in a sealed plastic bag, and shipped in a sturdy cardboard box. I don't really want to go through the hassle of returning the item, so I guess I'm out a pack.  It'd be nice if amazon shipped me one more packet! ;-)	0	1

1	B0017I8UME	A2NH6XPAZG881D	Sweet with a nice kick!	Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it's mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it's a steal!	2	0

-1	B000SDMFC0	AM8ORXO9KRX13	Call quality control! Beans were stale!	After getting a home espresso machine after months of anticipation, I was so excited to order these Lavazza beans after reading<br />several positive reviews. Many have claimed that these are some of the best of the Lavazza line, but I have to firmly disagree.<br />Although I have had delicious Lavazza coffee at restaurants, Lavazza's whole-bean coffee end needs to perform better quality control--despite an expiry date of August 2013, the beans I purchased have so far made just awful coffee, with a weak flavor, harsh acidity and a slightly stale taste as both drip coffee and espresso.<br /><br />I can't blame Amazon since the beans are indeed good for another 18 months, but buyer beware!	3	1
-1	B000UJW0W2	A1R7YXKHJZCPV1	Mat	The mat is OK since it does not cost much.  However, I did NOT want blue.  It was supposed to be Silver.  It does not match my room.

1	B001EPQ0J0	A2RXRKRI8YSQWQ	Very Good Coffee	I love ordering whole bean coffee on Amazon.  I like this so much that this my first product review.  I have to say that I'm usually not a big fan of flavored coffee, but I thought I would give it a try.  When my husband started grinding it up, I could smell it throughout the house.  Sometimes with flavored coffees, the smell is there but the taste isn't.  However, not with this one.  I'm now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try.	0	0

1	B00139TT72	A2EZW502SEA2N9	Best Dog Food Ever!	"Newman's Own is the best dog food ever, in my opinion. My 12 year old white German Shepard eats and digests this food wonderfully. Before changing to this food a few years ago, she had digestive problems often, even though she was fed a ""so called good brand name food"".  My three year old pittie girl also eats this food, and loves it .. she is in perfect health. I would recommend it to anyone. My next door neighbor orders it now from Amazon for his pittie girl. Amazon is a wonderful place to purchase dog and cat food, groceries, and anything you need .. the prices are always good, and the specials are great! The specials are the best ever, and I was shocked to find out that a today ""Friday"" special price on Newman's Own dog food was automatically reflected in my subscribe and save item price of the Newman's Own.  Even though I just received a bag yesterday, I ordered two more today, and some Newman's Own cat food.  What other retailer would automatically do that for you .. none that I know of.  Amazon .. please continue to offer the Newman's Own dog food .. I would be lost without the delivery, since it is difficult for me to get out and shop and carry large items like bags of dog food.  Thank you for being here for me and Snowey and Sophie.<br />  Linda"	1	0

1	B000LRKO9E	A8GR4PH5NW96V	Don't use this in place of regular molasses!	So I bought this pomegranate molasses to make Fattoush, the delicious middle eastern salad of greens, cukes, tomatoes and torn up bits of fried, leftover pita bread.  Wowee, Fattoush is now my favorite salad, I've eaten so often lately that the tart lemon-y dressing has made the corners of my mouth turn a bit pinkish and raw, youch. I tend to do that, find a food I really like, then eat it so much I almost make myself sick on it.<br /><br />Anyways, the Fattoush salad dressing, with it's complex blend of Sumac, olive oil and various herbs and spices required one half teaspoon of pomegranate molasses.  I was lucky enough to find it at a Russian grocery store (YAY!).  But the store is far away and so I had to look around online to buy more, thank God for Amazon.<br /><br />Now, granted, my bottle will likely last years if all I do with it is make Fattoush, one goopy half teaspon at a time, so I've used it in a few other things.  I added a teaspoon to a Lemon Chicken Marinade, a tiny glob to a bowl of greek yogurt (had to add honey too cuz it was sour!),  a tiny amount added to Christmas Salmon cream cheese log, I used it in Fesenjen, a persian stew of chicken and walnuts, I used a few tablespoons of the sticky stuff in a garlicky barbecue sauce and it was the best barbecue ever.<br /><br />Just don't do what I did and try to replace the molasses in molasses cookies with pomegranate molasses, what a horrible mess, the cookies looked normal, slightly lighter than normal, but the smell!  And the taste!  Ewwww!	1	1
-1	B004ZIER34	A2FYK4HWXZRLPN	Works As Advertised	As a rabid, unrepentant coffee-drinker, I had to try this product.  Although I love the flavor and texture of French roast coffee, it's acidity tends to wreak havoc once inside of me.  Given my (minimum) two-cup a day habit, coffee can be tough going, to say the least.<br /><br />The Puroast brand delivered on the caffeine, but I found the flavor to be a bit bland, both straight and with cream.  I generally like my French roast to be strong, sharp and over-powering (so as to awaken me with a jolt and keep me fully hyped up), but the flip-side of this is typically very high acid content with the usual medical complaints.  To achieve that same full sensory experience, I had to use a bit more of it- about 1.5 times the usual amount of grounds that I brew of typical French roast in order to achieve a similar 'kick' from the coffee.<br /><br />In passing, I also like to spice up my coffee with either 1) a little cinnamon and Kahlua (usually during winter) or 2) one part twenty-year aged rum, minimum two parts Grand Marnier, chasing both with a strong batch of French roast filled to the rim of the mug (a kind of after-dinner dessert on the weekends for me).  I tried the latter recipe with and without a touch of cream, and while typically the coffee tends to eclipse the flavor of the alcohol mix, with Puroast both the aroma and taste of the aged rum and the Gran Marnier came through right nice as my ever-so-sensible British friends are fond of saying.  I also found that for best results with the combo of aged rum and Grand Marnier, Nestle's Coffee Mate French Vanilla product provided the best results, which featured a smooth, even finish combined with a creaminess that was, well, positively orgasmic!<br /><br />In sum, this product is an adequate and satisfying entry to the coffee space, and I highly recommend it to those who literally cannot 'stomach' their coffee.	0	0

-1	B000EVIDUY	A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2	Tasty but Crumbly	These are tasty enough.  Indeed, if you mix in a tablespoon of raspberry jam or a half-teaspoon of cinnamon, these are QUITE tasty.  But they have no cohesion.  We try to cut them, and they crumble in the pan.  I know gluten-free baked goods tend to be more crumbly than the conventional stuff, but we made Betty Crocker, and they held together just fine.  As tasty as these are, I can't arrange them on a platter and serve them to my friends.  So I'll stick with Betty for a while, but thanks anyway.	0	0

As for design, Lychee White is part of Choice's new line, characterized by an innovative biodegradable pyramid-shaped tea bag which allows for the use of regular loose tea leaves.

For those that like their coffee mild, I brewed 7 oz cups.  For those of us that like it bold, I brewed 5 oz cups.<br /><br />As an earlier posted noted, it does have a slightly flavored quality to the taste that makes it stand out from other coffees.  The taste isn't obvious enough to turn off drinkers who want their coffee ""regular and black"" but strong enough to note for those of us that pay attention.<br /><br />I plan on trying all of Wolfgang's line.

1	B000G6RYNE	A2L9028WTVFL1I	Gourmet powerful Salt & Vinegar chips!	"Kettle brand chips are very crunchy.  I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the ""soft"" end of the ""soft/crunchy"" spectrum.  Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy.  If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand.  Otherwise, you'll love these chips.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY.  I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time.  I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically.  Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt & Vinegar has a gourmet flavor.  The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy!"	11	3

When I popped the lid to these the first thing I noticed was the foul smell. It made me gag. I can't even describe how bad this smelled. It was like rotten meat flavored jello. I didn't have the heart to make my daughters eat it so I gave it to my cats. None of them would go near it except for one who ate about 1/4 of it and walked away.

Accent--on the SUGAR. The sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple. It wasn't very maple-y. It was gritty, sweet and pretty much not great. Maybe the ""cane juice"" crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter. Anyway, it was a loser.<br /><br />I had heard much hype about this peanut butter, started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in New York. I happen to like PBJ and celery with pb--a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes. I gave it two stars--if you are making a confection or cookies, it could be very good, but as eat-alone peanut butter, I found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes."	0	0

It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon!<br /><br />Note: it is great to open a bag, smell the contents, pour a glass of milk, then dip the Macines in the milk.

-1	B000Z978SS	A2WJLVCE5S9JHP	not sweet enough	Not a very cost effective sweetener, takes too much to do the job.

1	B004K30HO2	A4OZRNH654Z3N	But Don't Use for Teas	"I have given this product five stars because it works very well for coffee with the filters that come with it.<br /><br />But my five stars come with a warning: don't use these little cups without using the little filters, especially with teas or tea-based coffee substitutes (like loose ""Teeccino"").  The tea-leaves swell to a far greater extent than water-logged, ground coffee beans.  They also swell much faster, which tends to clog the small, unprotected puncture at the bottom of the little cups.  So, not using the filter is a very, very dumb idea.  If you put less tea in the little cups, the tea still clogs the system without the filters!<br /><br />So.. Be wise, and use the cups with the filters.<br /><br />For what it's worth, though, the Solo ""My K-Cup"" works perfectly with all types of contents, with or without the little filters.  It's ridiculously expensive, however.  Happily, for me, who am not flowing with dough, the plastic cups (with the little filters) are an answer."	1	0

But, in fact, it's much, much worse than that. The new taffy has none of the full, rich flavor of the original product. Instead, it fills your palate with intensely and unpleasantly artificial flavors, and little else. Probably, manufacturing the candy using the original ingredients in their original proportions proved far to expensive. Unless the makers of the new taffy change their product to adhere to the original, I'd say don't waste your time or money on what presently amounts to a hoax."	3	0
-1	B002BCE9JS	A2DVLV5A19WA3X	Delicate	The idea is great.  I am a big fan of soup so being able to make a quick hot bowl very fast is great.  The packaging could not be better.  The noodles are not dehydrated like you find in most other quick soups.  They are soft and neatly contained in a seperate bag inside the bowl.  There are also separate small bags for the liquid flavoring and dehydrated vegetables.  This is a high quality product but for my personal tastes, it was simply too bland and delicate.  I did not enjoy this soup but will definitely try the other flavors.  The Korean kimchi had much more flavor and thicker noodles.	0	0

-1	B007JFMH96	A3T8WOFS5RD2IR	Soft yes, but not very flavorful (B-)	These look good, and while they are soft, they were not very flavorful.  My wife who really loves chocolate, gave these a B-, and would not buy them again.  Each cookie is sealed in a separate package, the package was easy to open, and each cookie is about 3 1/4 inches in diameter  -- a good size for a cookie, but huge, but not too small.

-1	B0030VBRIU	A39WWOFLLOQC3L	Blend your own baby food	I loved the stage 2 Spinach Mango Pear, although I found it too watery.  I had to add rice to get baby to eat it.  I got the stage 3 mama grain based on the fact that it is suggested for 7 month olds.  My baby is 9 months old and won't eat it.  I disagree that it tastes awful.  I'd eat it myself, but it is way too thick.  I got a case of it, so I'm going make it work.  So- I put the too watery stage 2 spinach mango pear and stage 3 mama grain in the blender and voila! Perfect texture.  Easy enough fix, however- I buy premade baby food because I don't want to blend my own.  I did with my 1st baby, but this is my 4th, and the novelty of making baby food, and the time required to do it- is long gone.  Happy Baby would do well to be more consistent in their labeling.  Their Stage 2 food should be 1.5, and this stage 3 should be 3.75.	2	1

And I wasn't really expecting authentic Vietnamese Pho noodles with this item, but it wasn't even remotely close to resembling that or any other Asian noodles.  I guess it's a matter of individual taste and preference with these things.  It didn't taste bad, but it didn't taste good either.  Not a lot of flavor, and what little flavor it did have I wouldn't describe as Vietnamese (or even Asian for that matter).<br /><br />I've also read a few reviews describing the portions as big, but it definitely was not.  Nissin's Cup Noodles taste better, are more filling, and a whole lot cheaper (but probably more unhealthy too)."	1	0
-1	B004R8J8EK	A2QCE7L6GRE3MT	Don't understand this product	If I were going to make breaded chicken my first thought would be to use generic breadcrumbs.  Shake N Bake does have a few pros - it's finely ground so it sticks to every surface of the chicken, and it does leave the chicken moist.  However, it's more expensive than generic breadcrumbs and is less flavorful.  The whole shake and bake concept could also be used with breadcrumbs... I am a little baffled as to why anyone would spend the extra money for Shake N Bake.	0	1

1	B006N3IG4K	A2FIC05DY3HT7J	Strong Dark Roast Coffee	This is about the strongest K cup I've purchased.  I like my coffee strong, and before buying a K cup coffee maker, always purchased French roast whole bean and brewed strong coffee.  Brewing this in a K cup machine at an 8 ounce cup will definately provide you with a strong cup of coffee.  Since I brew a cup for my wife and I at the same time, I run two 8 ounce cups with one of these K cups into a small decanter, and then pour into two coffee cups, which still yields a strong flavor, but not enough pop your eyeballs out...<br /><br />Of course, brewing two cups with one K cup drops the price down in half, which at less than thirty cents a cup is on the cheap end of K cup brewing.  I find most K cups are good for up to a 12 ounce cup, and 16 ounces would weaken them too much...  But this works for my wife and I since I have been fixing a cup for each of us for years, and brewing two cups with one K cup is economical.	0	0

-1	B004ZIER34	A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD	Low In Acid but Low in Flavor	"I love Folgers ""Smooth"" coffee because of its low acidity and ease on the stomach, so I was anxious to try Puroast Low Acid Coffee for a different flavor and to mix it up a bit in the morning.  Sadly, I was not impressed.<br /><br />While the coffee does have a robust flavor that definitely taps the tongue right at the first sip, I can't say it's a really good strong coffee flavor that I'd enjoy sipping.  It actually tasted weak by the second sip and after a while it just tasted old and bitter.<br /><br />I tried fixing it up with things like sugar or Splenda but got the same outcome.  By the second cup, I tried a shot of Baileys and it still just had a bland flavor after the first sip.<br /><br />I'll stick to my Folgers ""Smooth"" blend for now.  It's cheaper, not bitter, and keeps a constant flavor throughout that is quite pleasing."	2	0

-1	B001BDDTB2	A25C2M3QF9G7OQ	Three out of four cats approve; owner less enthused	"My gang is typically not very fussy when it comes to food - if it doesn't move (or, at least move too much) they'll eat it. So, I was pretty sure they'd like this up-scale food.<br /><br />Surprisingly, one did not - while she didn't turn up her nose at it, she didn't really want to eat it either.  The other three gave it their licked-clean food bowl seal of approval.<br /><br />The cans are small (the ""mini"" can size much like Fancy Feast) which is a good match for single cat households since you don't have to deal with leftovers. The smell is much better than the low-cost can foods, and about on a par with the more premium brands such as Hills. The chicken pot pie was VERY watery, however - more like a soup than a stew. The sesame chicken was a bit more solid. The watery nature of the product also makes it messy to serve. To me, it's not a very good value especially considering that you're paying for a lot of water.<br /><br />I don't think I'd get this again given the cost and the mess factor, plus the fact that  there are several other brands that provide top-notch nutrition at a lower cost (and less mess). I also try to purchase items that are US-made, and this is made in Thailand. But, the majority of the cats snarfed it down, so it's deserving of at least 3 stars."	0	0

1	B001O2IX8E	A3NHUQ33CFH3VM	Had No Problem.  They Like This One a Lot	I wondered why my 10-month olds liked this one so much when the other reviews weren't so promising.  Then I noted that it has twice the calories as the green bean casserole and sweet ingredients that are proven winners with my kids.<br /><br />Here's the ingredient list: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Mango Puree, Organic Finely Ground Chicken, Organic Whole Grain Brown Rice Flour, Organic Yellow Split Pea Flakes, Calcium Carbonate.<br /><br />Anything that starts with carrots and mango is going to be fairly sweet, and this one is sweet.  The consistency seemed very normal, perhaps because it has plenty of water - that's the first ingredient.  Unlike most Earth Best flavor brands, this one has calcium.  The stated amount is 35% of their daily needs.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.<br /><br />I recommend this particular one, Chicken Mango Risotto, because I think babies will tend to like it as mine did.<br /><br />These cases are being delivered to my home constantly, different varieties of Earth's Best subscriptions.  On occasion a case will arrive in a mess with one or more broken jars. Over time I figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage. Now when a case arrives with one or more broken jars, I report it and can get credited for the broken ones only. Of course it's messy when a jar is broken, but I don't have a store nearby that sells this product except one that lists it at a higher price.	1	0

I can't even describe how awful it tasted or what it tastes like. Luckily I bought it at a local store, and didn't pay the higher rate on here or shipping."	0	0

-1	B001TZL6ZS	A7PRO2V58AVY8	Not what I expected.	After seeing this on Oprah I thought I would be good. I was not impressed as it has too much smoke flavoring in it, which takes away from the bacon flavor. Sorry that it came in a 3 jar pack; however, I definitely won't buy it again.	3	2

-1	B003VXFK44	A2Q8K6RAHF7L24	Great Taste!	I love this coffee!  I am not a strong coffee drinker and this coffee is perfect!  I have no problems with it working in my Cuisinart Keurig Brewer, I aways get the perfect tasting cup of coffee.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because one of the 2 packs contained only 13 K-Cups and not the 24 that it was supposed to have.<br /><br />The decaf 24-count (pack of 2) arrived with the correct amount of K-cups and is as yummy as the high test!	0	0
-1	B001LG945O	ADZKP93810RSP	A solid juice offering	You know what one of my favorite sounds is? The sound of a can opening. I think it's weird, consider I'm not a huge soda drinker...since I find most sodas too be way too sweet or sugary.<br /><br />This is a review for an Orange Tangerine drink from Switch. I've never heard of them, but I was feeling kind of thirsty so I ordered a can from the vine program. It's an 8.3 ounce can of 100% carbonated juice (plus gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascborbic acid and soy). I don't know what to think about some of the ingredients, but I certainly do know that I like: that it's only 8 ounces and that it has no corn syrup!<br /><br />It tastes very similar to canned Minute Maid drinks, especially the Vallencia Orange offering...but does have a slightly sickly sweet aftertaste.  I don't know if I'd run out and buy a 24 pack, but if I saw this in a restaurant I'd definitely consider it as a tasty complement to a sandwich and potato chip lunch.<br /><br />The last thing I like is about the company: it seems to be an independently owned shop, and I like that.	1	1

1	B003EML8PM	A3P00SA2Y5OYZW	tasty & good value	When I read the reviews, I noticed someone mentioned the box was light.  It is, but it holds a lot - these pork rinds are compact; they expand when cooked, so there's a lot more in the box than it looks like.<br /><br />As snacks go, these are high in protein and low in carbohydrate.<br /><br />I think this is a really good value, and these are very flavorful - I especially enjoy them with bean dip.<br /><br />The only thing that I'd change is, I'd like a lightly salted version; I don't always want that much salt.	0	0
-1	B0007ZKS00	A9Q0F94C8NMVZ	Nothing to write home about	Believe it or not, I bought this at a yard sale for 50 cents.  The packaging was perfect and looked exactly like the photo.  It doesn't expire for another 6 months.  I can only figure the seller received the coffee as a gift and had no idea the cost.  I LOVE coffee and figured this would be very good but was so disappointed.  I wanted to see how much it would have cost me had I not bought it at a yard sale and almost fell over when I saw the going price on Amazon!!!!!!  There is NO way on this Earth I would pay the ridiculous amount here, but I will say I like the coffee more now that I know what a great deal I got!  :-)  I decided to try it again this morning and am using the sweetened condensed milk as mentioned by another reviewer (about 3 over-flowing teaspoons per cup - I like sweet coffee).  I also used less coffee since last time I felt it was too strong.  I still cannot pay the going price for this and figure most people on here buy it as a splurge thinking it is neat to drink Jamaican coffee.  I too like to experiment with foodstuffs from other places, but not at this price... Needless to say unless I find another at a yard sale, I'll never drink this coffee again once my 16 ounces is gone... except if I take a trip to Jamaica mon.  :-)	0	1

-1	B007M83302	A2YDU3RZB63VXW	Holy SALT, Batman!	"We are chip fanatics in our house and we decided to try these because of their claim of being a ""healthier"" alternative to regular chips.  I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.  Because of the salt factor, I don't think you can call these a ""healthy"" alternative to chips."	45	7
1	B004391DK0	A219EE3BLYDEZN	Tasty non-corn muffins	Neither myself nor my husband can have any type of corn products, but we love cornbread.

-1	B001P3NU30	A3R3XILQYOGYRE	Choking and vomiting	My mother-in-law bought these from our vet the other day because they aren't fattening and are good for teeth. My dogs love them (I have two Labradors). But, yesterday, I gave them each one to chew and my Chocolate Lab choked. He was gasping for breath, and fortunately threw up the chew and his breakfast. I say fortunately because I suspect he would have choked to death otherwise. My other Lab threw up over night, and I suspect it was from these chews. I'm getting rid of them and won't buy them again. These things should come with a warning label.	7	0
1	B001LG945O	A2TO2BN3P4C00L	tasty, lightly carbonated, good alternative for soda-pop	If you're a regular drinker of orange soda-pop, you might like this Switch orange tangerine carbonated juice beverage.  I thought the flavor was very good and appreciated that it was only mildly carbonated, not so fizzy that I had gas after drinking it.  At 140 calories per small serving, however, this isn't something I would regularly drink.  It's much healthier to eat whole fruit since it's more filling that simply drinking the extracted juice, in part because of the fiber associated with eating whole foods.  Still, this is a healthier option for those who regularly drink sugared sodas.	0	0
-1	B004ZIER34	AP8D74QD9LUUL	just ok	I liked the strong aroma of this french roast coffee, both from the pouch and when it was brewing.  But the flavor was off, and it left a strong aftertaste.  I do get heartburn on occasion, and can say I did not have any after drinking this.  However, the price is so very high, and the flavor is only mediocre, so it is hard to recommend this product, unless you absolutely cannot drink regular coffee without distress.	0	0

-1	B0016FY6H6	A2JV21UM89AIML	Trying this product for the first time	"I was looking for an alternative green or white iced tea powder after I realized that the Lipton brands all contained sucralose, and did not come in an unsweetened version.  I found Stash tea online and decided to try it, using stevia as the sweetener.  I bought the lemon ginger flavor.<br /><br />By comparison, I think the Lipton powdered iced tea I had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity ""kool-aid"" for adults.  This is different.  I am having to get used to the green tea taste, and it upset my stomach a little (when I drink hot tea, I usually drink white tea, because I like the mild taste).<br /><br />I tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better.  I would probably like white tea better, but Stash doesn't make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix.  Anyway I hope to get used to the taste.  Since right now I like it watered-down, it's really a good deal as far as price."	1	0

My cats barely like this stuff and it even hurts my fingers when I pinch it to release the aroma. Would not recommend this 3 oz size!	0	0
1	B001E5DZTS	A3TRXAWQBI0NXU	a godsend for infants!!	My 5mo daughter has a severely sensitive stomach associated to an iron intolerance. She's been formula fed since the beginning due to my personal choice. I went through 8 different commerical milk-based and soy-based formulas. A good friend of ours suggested goat's milk. Her nephew was a failure to thrive baby and the ONLY formula he didn't throw up was Goat's Milk. I can easily find the liquid Goat's Milk at our local grocery store. Unfortunately, I have yet to come across the powder at said grocery store. I was home visiting my parents and was in search of the liquid, but found the powder. Strange that a smaller grocery store in a much smaller metropolitian area would have the powder versus a very large grocery store in the US's 4th largest metropolitian who just has the liquid.<br /><br />Anyways, after 8 weeks of trial & error, we have a very happy 5mo baby. I wish would have found this milk earlier.<br />I added a mixture of goat's milk and pulp-free, plain coconut water into my daughter's feedings and it not only has cleaned her system out, but has stopped the colic, vomiting, reflux, constipation AND to replace her electrolytes. Again, I will repeat. Lower iron content equals happier, calmer baby. We still have the lingering green poops compliments of the iron oxidation; however, the iron tolerance has been greatly minimized. No colic, no vomiting, no reflux and no constipation. She has one bottle of coconut water/goat's milk every day just to keep the GI tract from metabolizing the excess iron proteins and to replace her ever so important electrolytes. Ironically, she actually takes this formula mixture better than the traditional formulas!!	0	0

1	B003OZYUEA	A1CUKGQKJXT1DB	Best water ever.	"I am a chemist, so I know about water, and why it can taste like heaven (e.g. it is tasteless), and why it can taste like sweat (e.g. ""mineral-enhanced.""). This water is expensive - cheap for online, but costly if you are a Walmart or Target shopper. However, I highly recommend you try this, if you want tasteless water. You see, when water is mineral enhanced, and its swirling around through the various protrusions and undulations the road provides in the summer heat, the water tends to build a certain taste, which some like, and others don't. I like my water tasteless. Therefore I recommend this product to those whom do not want H2O + minerals, but just plain water."	5	1

Manuever lid into place, then press down on center-STEADILY- w/ thumb.<br /><br />Plan to use no more than 6 Oz. of water for your cup.<br /><br />Removal of used cup from machine is occasional problem.

1	B0064O79BO	AIULJ4357GQOE	Super clean, crisp yeast. As close to lager from an ale as it gets	Just kind of yeast shopping one day. You're at the store and thinking, man, I really need to get me some new yeast. This sounded intriguing. An Alt strain, clean and rapid fermentation. Tolerant of cold conditions. In short, it is a hard working and industrious yeast that does its job without much fanfare. And it cleans up after itself. Only the Germans would have such a yeast. It's not like the California yeasts that are kind of fruity, or the British yeasts that just leave a mess. It's very German.<br /><br />You could easily pass this off as a lager yeast. I did a very simple wheat / pale malt light ale. 1.032 OG. 1.008 FG. Fermented at about 60-62 give or take. Grain to bottle in a week. I wasn't too concerned with flocculation or haze but that's just me. Cracked on the other day just to get a taste. Extremely clean. You can taste every single grain of the malt. I didn't hop it much. Maybe 15 IBU tops with magnum. Very nice lawnmower or pounding beer.<br /><br />Blow off tube is mandatory. Next project is a 1.062 American wheat. Blew out the airlock. I had 5 gallons in a 6 gallon carboy and it wanted enough space for 10 gallons. Very vigorous.<br /><br />If you want an absolutely crisp, clean yeast that produces very lager like beers and can tolerate temps down to about 55, this is it. Seems to really accentuate malt. Very nice yeast, but I like a little yeast profile so I don't know if I'm in love with it. Just impressed at how clean it is.	0	0
1	B001LXYA5Q	A2R8AISN4HCTW4	it works... sorta	I do reccomend this product, as it is effective and very fun to try. Here are the setbacks: It only lasts around 30 minutes, not 2 hours. I bought these in lieu of the actual berries ($90 vs. $10) so they weren't as potent as I had read about/expected. Nonetheless, they do work! Lemons and limes were delicious!<br />Oh, be sure to move the tablet over the ENTIRE surface of your tounge in order to cover ALL of your taste buds.	15	1
1	B005H3BYHI	A21FY4Y4M5DB2X	Love this stuff!!	This brand is a little hard to find in stores as i don't think it's carried by any of the major supermarket chains. I discovered it at Au Bon Pain and noticed that unlike other brands I've tried, this one is not from concentrate and has nothing added, it's just pure unadultered coconut water, so the quality can't get much better. The other thing i really like about it is that it's a glass container rather than paper or plastic, so the taste is not compromised. These things alone are worth 5 stars to me but there are a couple things I would suggest to make it even better. First, this isn't really pulp the way you would think of it from you experience with fruit juices where there's pulverized, very small, drinkable pieces floating in the liquid; these are chunks of diced coconut that you have to chew up while drinking. To me, this would be fine if they were all the soft flesh you'd expect from a young cocunut but many of the pieces are harder which is unpleasant in a drink. Second, 9.5 ounces doesn't go a long way, I'd like to see it bumped up to at least a 12oz, I'd then feel like I'm getting an adequate amount for my money and it would last longer and quench better.	0	0

All three dogs love it (even the picky one) and it seems to agree with their digestive tracts more than any other dog food that we've tried (I can't begin to tell you how pleased I am about THAT). I did a lot of research to find a quality food that isn't full of filler and won't break the bank. I am 100% pleased with this food, more so than any of the other more expensive brands that I've tried.	4	0

This is the 1st time I chose the Tropical Organic Green -- I have no doubt it is the best flavored tea I have ever had."	0	0
-1	B003EML8PM	ARYSDAZNRXN6G	A for freshness, but d*mn are they salty.......	"I was so excited to see these! And the price is good.<br /><br />First, it takes a little learning to figure out how to cook these. The instructions are not much help. ""Stop cooking when the bag stops expanding""....they might as well say, perform a Vulcan mind meld with the pork rinds to know when they are done. I found that the bag's expansion--or not---has little to do with whether they are done. I have a 1200 watt microwave and 1:30 was perfect. 1:00 and they were not cooked, 2:00 and I had charcoal bits.<br />I had to sacrifice a couple of precious bags to figure this out.<br /><br />Taste and texture? Well they are infinitely better than bags of pork rinds from the store. The texture is very good. The taste? I am in no way shy of salty food, love me some salt! But these were borderline too much for me. I did sprinkle some cinnamon and Ideal on them to make them sweet and I still had a hard time eating them. My husband liked them this way though.<br /><br />If they could back off the strong salty flavor, I would buy these again. As it is, I'm going to use them to make low-carb nachos. I won't be reordering them though. Love the crispy texture! But can't choke down the overpowering saltiness."	0	0
1	B000UZVPKO	A2BXMHV2B0QRCM	Most excellent sardines!	Just had my 1st can of these sardines and I am delighted!  Big sardines in the can with a most excellent mild flavor.  Made a tuna salad...but used sardines.  Wonderful!  I have to say that I really didn't notice that they were low sodium as far as affecting the overall sardine taste.  Love the ones without oil as I don't really like that greasy fish taste you get with some sardines.  I just got diagnosed with hypothyroidism, and I read that sardines are good to help restore your thryoid function.  I'll be ordering more of these!	2	0
-1	B0030VBRIU	AW249T3BHIMCV	Not a fan	The Happy Baby Beef Stew was not much of a beef stew.  The second ingredient behind water was tomatoes and it was evident in the taste of the product.  It didn't seem to have even a trace taste of beef.  Because of the high tomato content, the stew was very acidic.  I was a bit disappointed by this product.	1	0
1	B000TRFGGM	A3P2663Y7LYGA7	It was alive on arrival...barely	I opened the carton and the plant looked like someone put it in a shoe box and shook it all up.  I didn't think it would live.<br />It did recover however and a heat generating pad was included so I give it 4/5 stars.  knocked one for loose packing.<br />I would buy from this company again in hopes they get better at packing.	0	0
1	B003EML8PM	A2I3KPQFFD7GR8	Not Bacon, but still a great snack	I love reading reviews about the smell.  Have you really though this through.  We are taking pork rind pellets, and microwaving them till they expand.  It's frankly amazing they don't smell worse.  Beyond the smell of cooking rind (which I don't mind by the way), these snacks are great.  It took us a two bags to figure out the cook time.  To little and you don't get full expansion, to much and they get hard, I mean real hard.  For us it is 1 minute 30 seconds to perfection every time.  I really like the seasoning as well.  I don't find it offensively over board or chemically.  Basically it is a simple snack.	0	0
1	B000FF77YM	A3IPRYANW63ZXD	Good gum	This is an excellent sugar-free gum for those who don't want saccarine or aspertame. Many commercial gums that are advertised as containing xylitol also contain unnatural, chemical sweeteners. The flavor and soft texture lasts very well in the peppermint and fruit flavors. Another family member really enjoys the licorice one. The chocolate has a disappointing flavor, and the cinnamon, which to me tastes like almond at first, quickly gets hard and loses flavor. Haven't tried spearmint. While the serving size is listed as 2 pieces, I find 1 is exactly the right amount for my mouth.	0	0
-1	B007M83302	A19TDQXYI4O4Q1	just awful	Love the other flavors...this one is horrible.  And I cannot return...oops.  This flavor is almost a chemical one, does not taste anything like cheddar and my kids thought the same!	1	1
-1	B002DLXXHG	A37QGAKTILENKQ	Very Disappointed!	I am so disappointed. I also had the mold issue a lot of reviews were talking about. Since I paid for it I found a piece that wasn't touching the mold and tried it. I'm daring I know. The beef jerky was very tender. I know some might like that, but I like it a little rough. That's how beef jerky is supposed to be. The flavor was also really bad, but that is probably from the mold. I think the issue is the moisture. It makes it tender, but it is also leading to the mold issues a lot of people are experiencing. I won't order this brand again, which is a shame because it was a great price for the amount of jerky.	0	1
-1	B0084R5VKA	A3NG6F8XBA0VVY	Love the product, but this one was hard as a rock!	I am a big fan of Jem and I love the way it is so spreadable. This is the first time I tried the Coconut Cardamom flavor and I loved the flavor, but after the first use and I put it in the fridge, it was hard as rock and not spreadable at all. Flavor was fantastic and I did not have the problem with the Cinnamon Maca flavor - it spread like a dream down to the last drop.	0	0

I am focused on eating nutrient dense food and am avoiding putting into my mouth non-food items for entertainment only. I love crunchy foods and this is great. The flavors are all good except don't like the sweet maple and cinn. flavor as much.<br />My family doesnt like them because they are not evolved yet, immature taste buds is all I can say at this point. Start your babies off early and you won't have to erase habits of eating NON food for fun.	3	0

1	B006N3IG4K	A1H703P9ALYVM6	Good stuff, but overpriced	I do like this coffee, but even with Subscribe and Save, Amazon's price is higher than K-cups at Bed Bath & Beyond.  Convenience is one thing, but since there are BB&Bs all around me, it's pretty easy to pick up my coffee there and save a few bucks.  I wish Amazon would price their coffees more competitively - I'd buy here exclusively if they did.  But this is good, medium roast coffee.  Not quite as strong as I'd like, but a little stronger than the Breakfast in Bed version.  I may need to try Sorrento and see if it's a little bolder.	3	0

-1	B000H227BG	AYMVKO0YP7HXA	Not my cup of Cocoa	Very bitter!  I couldn't taste the coffee at all.  It basically tastes like baking cocoa.  No sweetness, no richness, not coffee.  I bought the 4 pack though, so I've begun mixing it half and half with Swiss Miss (in the can), and then sprinkling it with instant coffee after I've made a cup.  Even making it with whole milk couldn't make this yummy by itself.  If you like a rich chocolate taste with just a bit of coffee.... shop elsewhere.	0	0

1	B006F2NYI2	AFN9QJ7IE89N4	Love This Stuff	They have this in a local diner that I eat in regularly.  I use it on all kinds of foods and I love it.  It's hot, but not without flavor.  I don't like those sauces that just burn but have no taste.  This has both burn and and awesome flavor.  I was surprised to find it on Amazon (just stumbled across it).  I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good hot sauce.	2	0
-1	B001BSBFUO	A13H77WHFJF30U	Be careful, made my dog violently ill	"I must admit these do work for getting your pets to take pills - 2 very finicky dogs who almost always spit out their pills in any food did scarf their pills down when put in these. However, after only 2 pills (separated by 8 hours), one of my dogs (8 month old puppy) became violently ill about 2 hours after the 2nd pill pocket with numerous episodes of explosive diarrhea and vomiting (ultimately very bloody after 12 hours). It ended up costing us money for a vet visit and medicine to get the dog to get well, and a major scare that the puppy was going to die (could hardly move after 18 hrs of this). The medicine was not new, nor any thing else changed, so I presume it was due to these (certainly not going to try them again to see). Our other dog (adult) did fine, however. Maybe it should just not be used for puppies, or maybe it's just an unusual reaction, but if you google ""pill pockets diarrhea"", you will see this is an occasional known side effect.<br />Would suggest trying just one of these (or half of one) each of the first few days to make sure your pet is not intolerant of these. 1 out of 2 for me was not good odds."	1	2
-1	B002DLXXHG	A3AZMR12ZWD692	Wrong Product Description	I purchased this item based on the description that stated all natural ingredients and no nitrite.

A big disappointment.	14	4
1	B001RVFDOO	AHRNDSKWH1YBT	Love these, good variety pack	I do love PopChips. They work well with weight watchers, taste great and the crunch can't be beat. This pack has many flavors, with the salt and vinegar being my favorite, my husband loves the salt and pepper and my kids like original and cheddar.<br /><br />The one I miss is Sweet Potato. It is by far my favorite of the whole lot of flavors, but aren't included in this variety pack.	0	0
-1	B000KV61FC	A33W5JAFGHYRQZ	Did not work for us	We ordered the medium/large tug jug.  It smelled like plastic so strongly my dog would not go near it no matter what food we put in it.  I tried it with a friends dog four times and the dog could not connect that kibble came out when he let go.  All he wanted to do was tug.  The rope was so stiff he couldn't really get a grip on it and the rope also smelled of chemicals.  Between the BPA in the bottle and cap and the inflexible rope, we found it was unusable and sent it back.	0	2
1	B001E5E29A	A1IH5YW0X6DE26	A great backup from scratch	This is the pancake mix we go to when we don't have buttermilk in the fridge (don't think the vinegar trick is worth it so we always do fresh) to make Alton Brown's buttermilk pancake recipe.  This Stonewall mix is a good option and the flavor is the best of any store bought mix by far! It might cost more, but it really is superior to the other prepared mixes.	1	0
-1	B00389Q4XW	A2FL3ALEG2NQWG	Not so Chocolately.	I would not order these K-cups again.

It has a scoop (small) and says to put that in a cup (instructions for 8 oz.) and then put a couple ""shots"" of hot water!  Shots of water????  And you can add frothing milk.  Hum!  Confused but I guess I will work with it.  Hope it doesn't take the whole container (very large) to figure it out. I would have given it 5 stars had I understood the instructions!"	0	0
-1	B001RVFDOO	AH4GXZ45GSP54	Tasty but Salty	"So for a ""healthier"" snack it sure is salty. But then the salt is a way for them to make the chips taste better without additional calories.

These seeds make a great project for gardeners, cat lovers, and children, too.<br /><br />The hardest part of caring for these plants is keeping your cats from keeping from devouring them completely!

For those that like their coffee mild, I brewed 7 oz cups.  For those of us that like it bold, I brewed 5 oz cups.<br /><br />As an earlier posted noted, it does have a slightly flavored quality to the taste that makes it stand out from other coffees.  The taste isn't obvious enough to turn off drinkers who want their coffee ""regular and black"" but strong enough to note for those of us that pay attention.<br /><br />I plan on trying all of Wolfgang's line.

-1	B001SAVOR4	A2NP8RNW9T5BQF	Fake!	I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice.	0	0

Unfortunately, I haven't tried the ""old"" recipe so I can't make a comparison. The box I received says ""Classic Recipe"" so it may be that they have gone back to the old recipe? I'm not sure.<br /><br />I made this oatmeal with milk and found it to average. I don't mind eating it but I've had better. Even though sugar is second on the ingredient list, I didn't think that this oatmeal had a very sweet taste. I could just barely taste brown sugar and I couldn't taste a maple flavor at all. If I'm going to eat something with a lot of added sugar then I want it to taste sweet! This was very filling and kept me full until lunch time."	0	0

Needs more work in the taste area.<br /><br />Comes in a single-use foil pouch for coffee maker or French press.<br /><br />The science may be there & it didn't bother my stomach, but it didn't taste the best either.<br /><br />I'd rather get a great coffee & take an antacid with it to get the great taste. I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but like a nice cup of great coffee every once in a while.<br /><br />Might be OK for every-day coffee drinkers that buy regular, bulk coffee brands, but not for me.	0	0

This is it. I like this coconut water better than others I have tried. It isn't as sweet as the Amy & Brian brand, which I prefer. I do not use sugar so I found this brand to be the best.

-1	B001E6KBSK	A2HOBQ1UZ2QTSA	Buyer Beware!This product contains High Fructose Corn Syrup!	"It's no secret that high fructose corn syrup is detrimental to your health. Unfortunately, it's also no secret that it has replaced other forms of sugar in a disturbingly large number of manufactured foods. Even worse is that most high fructose corn syrup is made from genetically modified corn.<br /><br />Since the late 1980s, HFCS has replaced regular table sugar, honey, and similar sweeteners in practically everything. Prolonged consumption of HFCS is now the topic of much debate and we are learning that it can cause long-term damage to the body.<br />High Fructose Corn Syrup Dangers<br /><br />1. Significant Risk of Weight Gain & Obesity<br />2. Increased Risk of Developing Type-2 Diabetes<br />3. Hypertension and Elevated ""Bad"" Cholesterol Levels<br />4.  Long-Term Liver Damage<br />5. Mercury Exposure from HFCS<br /><br />Kelloggs and other manufacturers know this and are slowly getting rid of this sweetner. Look at the cover of Post Rain Bran. They are advertising that it contains NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP.I applaud them for this. High Fructose Corn Syrup is made from genetically modified corn from Monsanto which uses systemic pesticides in their seeds which is causing Colony collapse disorder in bees. I am a bee keeper and have been avoiding all products with HFCS in them to save my family and the bees. Watch vanishing of the Bees,Food Matters and Food Inc. They are all sold on Amazon.

-1	B000PDY3P0	A2JUJC0CI10OTH	Ok in a pinch, but found better alternative	Got this to go along with the Maxi-Matic 4oz machine.  It gets the 3 stars just because of everything being pre-packaged.  I didn't care for the flavor of the popcorn and found it not buttery and overly salty.  Will try to not dump all of the salt in next time.<br /><br />I found a better alternative was using a product called Butter-it which I purchased a gallon of through a local restaurant since it is sold by Sysco. It is a soybean oil base so it's liquid. Use 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 heaping cup of kernals and if you want add a splash of salt and it is the best popcorn I have ever had....well, it is the same as in the pub I got the oil from, but still the best.	2	1

1	B000X2CWTM	A60ATYEZM715O	Close to perfect	this black licorice has great flavor and texture. Some are too soft and too sweet for me. Personal preference I'm sure, but I like this because it's slightly firm (not hard but not soft) and the sweetness is just right. Love that it's only 4 ingredients: molasses, wheat flour, licorice extract and aniseed oil. Price is good too. Compares to Tire Tread Licorice which is my first choice but I can't find it.	4	0

1	B001L1DYAA	A2H0LE9337ABAN	Wonderful, smooth, rich taste	"Several Gevalia brand coffee's have been among my favorites for years....Velvet Noir, Signature Blend, Traditional Roast, etc.  The Breakfast Blend is my ""go to"" every day grind.  It's got a perfect blend of bold rich taste, terrific aroma, and full taste, with very low acidity and harshness.  Just incredible coffee!"	0	0
1	B00139TT72	A33PVCHCQ2BTN0	Great product, my dogs love it!	I buy Newmans Own adult dog food for my two chihuahuas.  I've always fed them natural, human-grade dog food, even though most brands can be a bit pricey.  Like most pet parents, I try to do the best I can for my dogs which starts with feeding them right.  Most dog food can be disgusting and the practices behind it are disturbing.  Newmans Own is more affordable, and I feel good about the company's ethics and practices so it was worth a try.<br /><br />My dogs love it so it was easy to switch from the other brand.  They gobble it up! I now have it on subscription so we don't run out.	0	0
1	B001RVFDOO	A2N7B4N48D35S4	pop chip goodness	I first tried them after a product get together at Jelly Belly in Fairfield, Ca. I was so pleased, that I wanted more!  Well my Husband said he saw some at Costco so he got a few flavors and boy was I hooked. I sent my Grandsons in Idaho a box of 24 mixed small packages and also a friend in Ohio the same thing.  I am on a calorie counting diet along with my Husband and we eat the popchips almost every day. I like the different flavors and the fact they are healthy for you...alot better then baked or fried.  I am sold and really enjoy them...you came up with a fantastic product.  Sincerely, Viki Crabtree	0	0
-1	B003OZV53O	A25BMC59UPBGMD	Great Product, Terrible bottle.	For some reason Talking Rain got Yuppie, and changed the bottle from a short squat version, to a tall version that falls over.  I used to buy these and would again if they brought back the old bottle.	0	3
-1	B002DLXXHG	ATN552TF5V40Z	Tender jerky in some bags not others	I really like the size of the pieces and the tenderness of the jerky I've had so far. I've only had one of the 4 packages that come in an order. I am not thrilled with the Teriyaki flavor but it's ok, not too salty. The sweet hot is really hot so beware. This brand is the first jerky I am willing to re-order, which says a lot. Usually I get grossed out by the amount of sinew in packaged jerky but I have not found much in this brand yet.<br /><br />Updating after opening all 4 bags that came in an order: 3 bags were good but the 4th bag was all gristle and fat. There was not one piece that was edible in it. So they definitely have a quality control problem. Pity, because the good pieces are quite good, though the teriyaki flavor is a bit chemical for me. Still better than most other jerky brands	0	0
1	B001RVFDOO	AWS45Z6KQA30O	Loved it!	Very tasty chips, healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor. In fact, the taste is better than most regular chips I've had. Would highly recommend this product! If you had to choose, my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar, followed by salt and pepper. Ironically, the original flavor was my least favorite, probably because I was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer.	0	0

1	B003UIDAHY	A3UCN2RGY7O6S1	Good!	Each box is 8oz and usually I make 8oz mixed with some lean protein for a meal for both my husband and I, and if we have leftovers, it's rare.  This time however, I had half of it leftover only b/c we felt full and couldn't eat anymore.  I wonder if this is b/c of the high amt of fiber. Whatever, this morning my hubby tells me he's down 3 lbs. too.  I'm jealous. Also, I've been on an eating binge almost 2 weeks, always feeling unsatiated. Last night I had no strong urges to eat snacks.  I ate an apple more out of habit to eat something than b/c I was truly hungry. I won't say this is the outcome for everyone, but I thought I'd share.  I'm using the leftover pasta in my bean soup tonight. I'd like to eventually try the different varieties of shapes of pasta now, too.	2	0

-1	B001LXYA5Q	AOYGPHW4YMYEO	Does nothing	After reading several glowing reviews about this product, I decided to buy it and see for myself how great it is.<br /><br />After following the instructions, I taste tested a variety of items, that were suggested on the packaging. None of which seemed to have any affect. On lemons, I noticed a slight taste change, however the lemon was no sweeter.<br /><br />Bottom line; the product is over-hyped, and in my opinion, is not worth the buying. I know it's definitely not something I will ever purchase again.	3	4
1	B000ED9LDU	A1IU7S4HCK1XK0	Lovely seeds for your cereal, baking or yogurt	In Europe, you find a bowl of dark flaxseeds to the side of the muesli set out on a breakfast buffet. A great source of Omega-3 oil, you can improve your health by eating these tasty, nutty seeds. They are good for the gut and good for the heart.<br /><br />The golden seeds are an attractive alternative to the nut-brown seeds. They look nice in baked goods like lighter breads. They taste the same as the dark seeds. Ground, they don't show up in white bread, so you can bust some up in the blender and throw then into your standard bread recipe and add needed nutrients and fiber.<br /><br />We like them sprinkled on oatmeal, muesli or yogurt.	20	0

-1	B000SDMFC0	A2G95XU4Z814XG	Not Quite	I was excited to buy a larger bag of organic Lavazza beans at a good price. While not a coffee / espresso snob, I do like coffee and have lived and imbibed in enough coffee-centric countries to have some points of comparison. This is a good coffee, but not a flavorful or very distinctive coffee. I bought it to use in a stove top espresso maker - not a pulled shot - where it did well as the base for a nice cappuccino or latte...but not exceptional. As an Americano or in a Bodum, it didn't work for me. Just strong, a little bitter...someone here mentions a lemon overtone and while I don't normally go for the descriptive terms, I think the lemon overtone is a problem for me too. It's a strong coffee, a little bitter, not smooth, lemon acidic overtone, verging on dark roast, not too oily...serviceable, but not in anyway distinctive in its flavors. So I am moving on.	1	0
-1	B0051W6OAW	A2PT8FKPKCSY93	service good,,product not as expected	I purchased the Dipsy Dog Mix with the expectation of a good tasting corndog.<br />Whey I fixed my corndog, it tasted like the frozen corndogs you can buy at Walmart or any grocery store. Taste was not good.....	1	0
-1	B004R8J8E0	AA460WUKL3BC6	Bland and not worth it!	For much less than the buck per package it costs, you can easily make a tastier breading.<br /><br />The entire family gave this a 2 star rating (two adults and 3 kids).  There was not much flavor nor texture added to the pork chops.<br /><br />It was certainly easy, but it doesn't take much to fix up your own breading so saving an extra couple of minutes is not worth the lack of flavor in my opinion.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I would not recommend this product and will likely stay away from other Shake 'N Bake products.	1	0
-1	B0030VBRIU	A5993LK5CYHAA	It does not taste good	My baby does not like this kind. I do not like it either, it tastes fishy. Salmon is good for baby brain development. I tried to put butter or some seasoning to cover the fishy taste, but my son still does not want to eat it. He like other happy baby product like spinah, mango and pear, blue berries, banana and beet and broccoli, pear and peas. This one needs seasoning or I will not eat it either.	0	0
1	B0001217OA	A3F3B1JPACN215	Fantastic	"With all natural ingredients and no preservatives; all I can say is ""fantastic"".  There is no expiration date but I would eat this within a week or two -- faster if it's opened.  Absolutely excellent!<br /><br />You can freeze these with no loss of quality.<br /><br />Don't order if the weather is hot because they ship it in cool bags with cold packs instead of styrofoam with dry ice.  My orders usually arrive cool but not cold."	2	0
1	B004NC7IFQ	A3S15YGZ6W6EV2	WOW!  What a Deal!!	I like loose tea, I just don't like chewing on leaves in my tea cup, or having to dispose of a bunch of loose, soggy leaves that seem to find every corner of my kitchen. However, I'm spoiled rotten and only like the flavor that comes with brewing loose tea. So I've been using these empty tea bags in order to make loose tea a lot less messy and just as convenient as bagged tea. Most bags of this type I've encountered are made in Europe and come with a price to match, and a single pack of 100 doesn't last a whole long time.  When I saw this deal here on Amazon, I went for it.<br /><br />The bags look and work identically to the European made ones, although I believe these are made in India. (where they know a whole lot about making tea) But the price is about 2/3 less than that of the European made ones. I can't argue with that. (Well, I could argue with that, but I'm not a dope) That way, we can have the best tea on the market, which is sold loose, without the pain in the neck features of brewing loose tea with a tea ball or strainer. Just throw in the right amount of tea, tuck the top flap into the bag, and that's it. You now have a teabag of your favorite Kenyan Black tea (or whatever makes you happy) Throw away the neat little soggy bag when you're done - no mess at all.<br /><br />I've decided to get these on as a subscription, with a 6 pack arriving twice a year. That way, my family can have three cups or pots of tea each day (This size works for both), and maybe a few more on the weekend before running out. We've been using these bags for several months now, and are still as happy with them as we were when they arrived. If Amazon keeps offering these bags, I am sure we'll keep buying them!	0	0

1	B004K30HO2	A3EI6K24F9JI4Y	Great way to use your own coffee	Great way to use your own coffee rather than buying k-cups.  They are great because you don't have to change out the holding tray and there is no mess, u just toss them like you would a k-kup, no washing out of the filter every time.  It would be nice if there were not 3 parts to the process (filter already in cup).  I just load up 10 at a time and am set for the week.	0	0

The distributor should market these as chocolate cones and not try to pass them off as something else.  Note:  Be especially leary since this seller doesn't list ingredients.	0	0
1	B004K30HO2	A14N3D9Y4AMH8P	work fine, make great coffee, but w/o true saving	These work just fine after spooning ground coffee into a series of these cups (do it over a plate with ground coffee in a small bowl). Doing so, you get just the fine coffee you want and are not trapped by the standard selections. But there's no saving money: $14/lb coffee works out to 25 cents per cup plus the 25 cents per DisposaKup gives 50 cents per cup, about the price of regular k-cups. Darn! Hoped I'd save money but I do get my choice.	0	0

1	B000ED9LDU	A85V7EAHDOMA4	They're Good Seeds.	These Flaxseeds are of good quality, I eat them daily.  Bought the whole seed, rather than the ground seed, because of the better nutritional value of grinding your own.  Will buy again.  I read that whole seeds can pass undigested, and that ground seeds can loose their nutritional value over time.  So we grind a week's worth at a time.  Best used in oatmeal as the flavors blend well.  Or in a cold cereal, or added to a cup of coffee for a twist. Seem to blend better in hot foods.	0	0

-1	B0030VBRIU	A2GV478E8T0QGN	I'd rather make this combination myself	I believe the concept and the intended combination of ingredients is nutritious and may be delicious BUT not in this little package.  My 11 month old daughter took one bite and literally spit it out.  I tasted it and it was so lacking flavor.  I'll be making this combination for her on my own in our Beaba BabyCook.  The other fruit and veggie combinations are great, but this offering missed the mark completely.	0	1
-1	B0002HDLZM	A4PT2IMOHIE1F	Product Good, Service Lacking	There was nothing wrong with the pastries--everyone seemed to like them, so you'll be fine as long as they don't mess up your order.<br /><br />I ordered two boxes of pastries for Christmas gifts, but the shipping was slower than expected and, more importantly, they only sent *ONE* of the two boxes.  I tried calling them and got a recording--figuring they were probably just busy because of the time of year, I also sent them two e-mails.  So far I have not heard back.  The shipping label was attached directly to the SINGLE pastry box (rather that being affixed to a larger cardboard box that could possibly hold two) and said BOX 1 of 1, so I know it wasn't a delivery service problem.  They simply only shipped one of the two boxes that I ordered.<br /><br />Mistakes can happen to any company, but the fact that they are hard to get in touch with and won't return my e-mails is just poor customer service.	9	1

The best part of this product, though, is the taste!  The worst part is that the actual thin is 2-4 bites and gone...all deliciously, though.

1	B000F9Z1WI	A2II54B3VA45LN	They're not bad	Let me begin by saying that I do not like Oreo cookies at all. I think the cookie part is bitter and I hate the white cream filling. When a friend suggested I try these I was reluctant and kept telling her that I was not interested. She insisted so I tried a few and surprisingly did not find them to be bad at all. I'm diabetic, so this is not a snack I will be eating often, but a few here and there won't hurt. If you're expecting these to taste like Oreo cookies (I'm one who's glad they didn't!!), then you'll be disappointed. But if you want a chocolate snack that's low in calories and fat please give these a try.	0	0

1	B0028VAQSU	A366C59ZU3XF2Q	Pamela's WHOLESALE Baking & Pancake Mix	Pamela's makes an awesome, delicious, easy to use wheatfree baking mix.  The 25 lb bag is clearly a wholesale product, coming in a brown paper bag without any fancy labels.  In January Amazon was selling this product for $66 which was clearly an appropriate price for a wholesale item, especially if you compared it to the other sizes of the same baking mix.  Now they are charging $82 for the exact same product which makes it MORE expensive than buying the same product offered as 3 of the 4 lb bags in the very pretty retail packaging.  Something isn't right with this product offer, anymore.  Shame on you Amazon.  You're supposed to be above such schemes!<br />STILL, swear by Pamela's wheatfree Baking & Pancake Mix.

I got this toy to keep her busy, and while it does take her a long time to clean it out, the toy is simply too loud. Roxy likes to kick this toy across the floor, sending it flying into the wall or the table. The hard plastic of the toy scrapes across the hard wood floor and then makes a loud ""bang"" as it slams into things.

1	B001LG945O	A2PTYGISR56RN9	Yum - carbonated fruit juice	I enjoyed this drink.  It has a tangy citrus flavor which tasted a little less orangy than I expected, but was still good.  I liked the carbonation in the juice - it was about the right amount for me.  The drink has about the same calories as a regular soda, but I feel better about drinking it because of the natural ingredients.  The drink does not have the syrupy feel of a traditional orange soda which is a bonus.  This is definitely a lighter tasting, very refreshing drink.  The only reason for reducing the star value by one was because of the price which is a bit extravagant for me.  I recommend this drink.	0	0

1	B00139TT72	A2KWAK0GAA8IBW	Give it time	I adopted a dog that was raised by a bunch of frat age boys.  You can imagine the diet she had; Burgers, fries, ice-cream, and the cheapest dog foods on the market.<br /><br />No, she wasn't crazy about Newman's dog food when I switched her to it.  But if you think about how people react to a healthy diet in the beginning it makes sense.  It takes time for the taste buds to adjust and not want the artificial ingredients put into most of the food out there.<br /><br />It has been almost a year.  My dog, Molly, is bouncy and healthy and almost allergy free. She gets dry Newman's fed free style, and 4 ounces of Newman's canned every day.  Her weight stays stable at 65 pounds which is perfect for her. Her treats are real meat jerky strips a few times a week.<br /><br />On another note, this diet has made doggy duty much easier. She never vomits anymore. Her scat is always firm, making her easy to clean up after.  She is regular as clock-work.  All these plusses make it more enjoyable to be a dog owner.	35	0

-1	B001P28DHY	A3I6J5XFJW8ELI	HealthWise Decaf Coffee	"I do not particularly care for this coffee. However, in all fairness to the product - this was my last ditch effort to find a decaf coffee that I like. I truly enjoy regular Colombian, organic coffee. I have tried other, non-organic decafs before and was dissatisfied. I thought maybe an organic version would suit my taste buds. Considering that I always find decaf coffees less than enjoyable, please do not take my review as ""gospel"". I would recommend that anyone who is trying to reduce their caffeine intake should try this product and make up your own mind. I only drink 1 1/2 cups of coffee in the morning. So, I'm not abusing caffeine. However, I think I just enjoy the flavor of ""real"" coffee too  much to enjoy the taste of straight decaf. Currently, I'm doing a scoop of regular organic coffee and a scoop of HealthWise. At least I'm getting closer to my ""caffeine free"" goal. :-)"	4	2

She never mentioned whether she liked the soup, so I asked.  She finally admitted that it was, to quote her, ""The worst thing I've ever tasted"".  Apparently her boyfriend also tried it and thought it was bad as well.

1	B000FNEX50	AVFVXW75F5Q2O	Nana Banana - a delicious gluten-free treat for kids or adults!	"Let me preface this review by saying that in the gluten-free world, baked goods tend to be a bit on the crumbly side because they are missing the ""glue"" (gluten) that holds them together.  Taking this into consideration, Nana's gluten free cookie bars are one of the tastiest gluten-free treats and one of the only brands sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar.<br /><br />At only 130 calories, 4.5 grams of fat, and 7 grams of sugar (natural fruit sugar), the Nana Banana flavor of cookie bars makes a great treat for kids and adults.  The amount of banana is just right, and you even get a few tiny bits of crunchy banana inside.<br /><br />Each cookie measures approximately 3.5 inches long by 1.5 inches wide...perfect for a light snack or dessert, especially for kids.  Amazon has the best price around on Nana's Cookie Bars, so rest assured that you are getting a good deal, even though they are pricier than ""regular"" cookies made with corn syrup and sugar.<br /><br />Good cookies aren't cheap, and cheap cookies aren't good!

"I bought these when they were on a Gold Box deal...thinking that it would be a nice inexpensive toss in for a month of lunches...and then I'd never buy them again.<br /><br />Not so...<br /><br />They're actually really tasty!  Exceptionally crunchy!  And the flavor is similar to kettle cooked chips.  Definitely going on subscribe and save for a while.<br /><br />I don't think they're any more salty than standard potato chips...but they're by no means ""low salt."""	0	0

1	B000G1769G	A31BZEQMPKS5MY	A hearty delicious soup	"I love Amy's because you can actually pronounce all the ingredients she uses--no chemicals, no preservatives, nothing you need a chemistry degree to decipher--and she makes pretty tasty food.  Normally, I'm not a big fan of canned soups, but the Alphabet Soup is an exception.  It's a rich tomatoey broth with a few vegetables and pasta alphabets.  I like soup without a lot of ""clutter,"" so to speak.  My sole complaint is that the alphabet noodles are a bit mushy, but then what do you expect in a canned soup?  Still, if you're looking for something to warm you on a chilly or rainy day, Amy's Fat Free Alphabet Soup fits the bill."	4	0
1	B004WM0ZTS	A2SN1C0KVT7K4K	Convenient and Tasty	I bought these for my husband because he occassionally likes a cup of coffee at home and it is a hassle to drag out the coffee maker and grinder when he only wants one cup and it's not everyday.  It also comes in handy when guests come over, because we don't tend to keep coffee in the house.<br /><br />Each serving comes in a little pouch that you can easily slip into your pocket, briefcase or travel bag.  The flavor was rich and at around $1.00 a cup, much cheaper than going to Starbucks or anywhere else and grabbing a cup on the way to work.<br /><br />It dissolves completely leaving no grit or residue.  He first tried it in a 12 ounce mug and found it to be a little strong, but was perfect in his 20 ounce travel mug.<br /><br />[...]	9	0

-1	B003VXFK44	A3PJ0TNZOJ2MCI	Good taste but secretly  DECAF	Taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before I mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning.  Small print on the bottom of the box (I mean 6 point font) tells this.  Several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided . . . this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine. I don't know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale.	13	2
1	B00016UX0K	A3OHLFE8MIT0IZ	Great Sauce!!!	A really great Sauce but is slightly more expensive than in other stores. It is great for egg rolls or a dipping sauce for many chinese foods! It is also a great sauce to make Chili Thai sushi roll.	2	0
-1	B001KVPC0G	A18TST0YO1NN2	Too salty to eat	These almonds had an unbelievable amount of salt on them. I love salt but this was over the top.

Maybe the machine went wacko when processing these. ???<br />I can't eat these unless I take the time to try and wipe off the salt, which talks forever!!	1	2
1	B001EQ5EQE	A1MH0BQU601U4H	Guess it's a matter of taste...	I buy Lavazza regular espresso in the black can pretty regularly, as I consider it the smoothest tasting of all in the supermarket.<br />This decaf in the green can is just as good, but lacks the kick of caffeine.<br /><br />One reviewer loves Bustelo; well it's a matter of taste. I found Bustelo to be harsh and unpleasant.<br />C'est la vie.	0	0

1	B001FA1L7K	A204906HLJ443E	perfect size!	The normal 15oz can is too much SPAM for one person.  The 7oz version is perfect for me to make two sandwiches.  I cut the block in half.  Each half I cut into 4 slices.  The 4 slices are perfect to lay on top of a toast.  With some salad green and 2nd toast, it becomes a quick and filling lunch sandwich when I hike or backpack (need sodium to replace electrolyte).  The 2nd half will become my 2nd sandwich if I do overnight backpacking (for dinner).	1	0

Yeesh. I was expecting something like an ""Archway"" cookie from the mid-70s -- soft cookies you'd put in a lunchbox. I'm unclear what the story is with these cookies, but they're just not very good. Far from what we expected. Not worth buying."	0	0
-1	B000A3TVBQ	A146KEDHOD7AS9	Royal Canin--Not the crown jewels of dog food	I tried this pricey dog food for my Australian shepherd on the advice of a friend who has a  small dog does that does very well on one of their foods geared for toy dogs.  First of all, making a decision on what food to buy is confusing.  They have many breed specific foods and to look at all the bags is exhausting.  With the help of a sales clerk I picked the Medium Breed adult. My dog, at first did like the food very much but I felt he was overwhelmed by the amount of food I had to feed to maintain his caloric need and gradually he lost interest in eating it.  The ingredients list was pretty standard but did have nice levels of antioxidants and omega oils.  Certainly this was not worth the price tag.	0	0

Both of my kitties are very active, have soft shiny fur, and neither are fat. Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth, also.	0	0

-1	B000KV61FC	AUPSAEJT4DEXO	Rope does not last long	I have a 10 month old golden retriever and this product, while I liked the bottom opening for easy loading of food/treats (some toys dont even have that), the rope is not very long lasting for a heavy chewer. It only lasted &lt; 24 hours before the strands got unraveled and i had to cut it off. Now i'm just using the bottle itself as a food/treat dispenser, which is just like a Kong Wobbler. My dog, after just 2 days with it, has already figured out how to get the food out as quickly as possible - by grabbing the bottom of the bottom with his mouth and lifting it upside down. Putting large treats or pingpong balls inside will help make it more challenging.	0	0
-1	B0007A0AP8	A1KAPGX1EPJ5VN	Pets don't like this one.	We have two cats and four dogs. The cats seemed to like this treat but the dogs turned up their noses at it. One of them, a Chiweenee, eats just about everything and he would not touch it. He tried it and left it laying on the floor.	0	0

-1	B0078Y6OX8	A2XBUM8UEFJGIW	Meh....	"I would actually give this coffee 2-1/2 stars, as I don't hate it, it isn't awful, but very ""meh"" for me.  As others have said, nice raspberry aroma and noticeable raspberry taste, but that's it.  The only flavor I detected (close to overriding the coffee altogether, so you could almost be drinking flavored hot water) is the raspberry.  The coffee is WEAK, no buts about it.  If you like coffee with body/""legs"", you won't be happy.  Very watery-tasting 'mouth feel.'  I can say it's weak because in order to fill my 14 oz ""cup"" I brewed *two* K-cups - one 6 oz. and one 8 oz. - likely smaller than most people would brew.  It was still weak.  I suspect that if I had brewed two 4 oz. cups it would still have tasted like raspberry water to me, because of the flavoring itself.  Not sure what I'll do with the remainder. Maybe try adding 4 oz. shots of it to a full-bodied coffee."	0	0
1	B003EML8PM	A2XNN8CP3C0D65	Pork rinds	A friend of mine sent me some of theese, and I thought it sounded kinda gross. But found they were quite good for a snack, but the only place I've found them on the west coast is online	1	0
-1	B003VXFK44	A10H24TDLK2VDP	Unremarkable	"First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG"">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees."	0	0
1	B001LXYA5Q	A1VNOV3K0GS14L	Neat stuff	Chewed a few of these and ate cheese, hot sauce and a bunch of citrus. Pretty neat stuff. If it was less expensive I could see this benefiting those who'd like to cut down on their sugar but still enjoy fruits.	2	0
1	B001EQ5CK2	APIIRLP1JR2VI	Great coffee, great price!	This has become our new coffee of choice for the mornings.  It's a good price for a solid cup of organic coffee.  Beans are medium roast and very fragrant.	0	0
-1	B004ZIER34	A71W7G4TCTH3T	Coffee-Lover Not Impressed!	I drink am a frequent coffee drinker - at least a couple of cups a day.  So I was glad to see this product available.  I often switch between light roast and dark roast coffee - depends on time of day, my mood, and availably.  I like to enjoy a good Dark French Roast at night.  I made a pot of this for my husband and me to try.  We were not impressed - it had a strong odor, and a very bitter after taste (neither of us finished our cup).  As far as the impact of the low acid - we couldn't judge since we didn't drink enough.	0	0
-1	B000FBM3YK	A1RC8J259UP7S9	Arrived melted/stuck together	The title says it.  Some of the cookies arrived with the chocolate melted.  Others were stuck together or had the wafer separated and stuck to the chocolate top of the cookie below.  It appears that the box was a little overheated and banged around somewhere along the way here.  It was 65F here when the package was delivered.	1	0
-1	B004ZIER34	A1L20MX19ZMNW5	"Just ""Okay"" Low Acid Coffee"	SMELL OF DRY GROUNDS: Very strange. Different than regular coffee. A little like sweet garbage. Made me worried that the coffee would be disgusting.<br /><br />SIZE OF BAG: Enough for about 5 generous scoops.<br /><br />TASTE OF BREWED COFFEE: Passable. Nothing great, but nothing bad. Had a slight wang and a little bit of an aftertaste like old or cheap coffee.<br /><br />ACID: A 3-ounce bag wasn't enough to really determine if it was easier to digest than regular coffee. Neither of us drinking the coffee seemed to experience any acid reflex afterward. Still, not enough to truly tell.	0	0
1	B000ER6YO0	A3MA4VWLFOCJ41	A great place to start	I would love to say that I have the time to make my son's food everyday. Its not the case. Honestly, I do make it most of the time, but some days, you just don't have the time/energy to get it all done. Enter this product. Before I bought this baby food, I read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it, its like a dessert, yadda yadda yadda. The truth is, is that yes, it has a bit of fruit in it, but its not sweet at all. The fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you don't have to add anything else. Its a great product to enter proteins into baby's diet. The consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal  to it also, baby will not choke on it. I highly recommend.	1	0
1	B0016FY6H6	A34OXX5PQ1XEHB	Powdered Green Tea by Stash	Powdered green tea with lemon & ginger provides quick daily source of antioxidant ingredients desired but in higher concentration and without the bother of brewing tea bags.

-1	B0030VBRIU	A1B0RFUNJWZ35T	Why mess with a good thing?	What HAPPYBABY needs to realize is that when you have a steady customer base, you should not change the recipe of a product!  My daughter loved this original recipe, but this recipe is COMPLETELY different.  I tried giving it to her 3 times - she refused to eat it.  I then blended it with chicken broth and she does eat it now, so it turned out to be a texture thing.  HOWEVER, the whole reason that I purchase products such as these are for the convenience of having an organic product that can travel easily - so it is very impractical for me to travel with chicken broth and a blender!  I'll be cancelling my subscribe and save subscription to this product.	4	0
-1	B003X7S45U	A3A7IQFYDEZFL1	Taste nothing like pumpkin pie or vanilla	This coffee taste nothing like pumpkin pie or vanilla, but does have a smooth taste.

-1	B000UJW0W2	A3K2F03FWDOBHO	Not Big Enough	The thick plastic that this mat is made of is really easy to clean, as you can just vacuum up any excess litter.  Some cats may not like the pointed surface of the mat; my cat doesn't seem to mind.  The main problem is that the mat is so small that most of the time my cat ends up exiting from a different side of the litter box, and thus the mat doesn't do any good.  I'm looking to purchase a different mat, because the small size of this one renders it all but useless.	0	0
-1	B002TMV34E	A3U5JCXIXTGSLN	Pretty Good Cup of Coffee	I enjoyed this coffee for it's smooth flavor that wasn't extremely strong. It's definitely better than most brands you find in the grocery store. I would recommend this to someone interested in a solid cup of coffee.	0	0
-1	B007POT6RM	A3LZA698SQPCXE	Recipe Changed - Bland	Oatmeal has become a daily staple of my diet. Most days I just start from the plain oatmeal and add brown sugar and raisins.  But every once in awhile I like to splurge on the pre-packaged oatmeal like I used to eat as a kid.  Sure the sugar is a little higher but nutritionally it's a much better option than other snacks. Only 160 calories per packet. Quaker instant oatmeal packets are just as good as you remember them. If there were any way to improve this product it would be to make the oatmeal a little thicker.  More like rolled oats.  Other than that,  Quaker Maple and Brown Sugar oatmeal is awesome.<br /><br />26JUL12 REVISED RATING: My kids tell me this oatmeal is really bland compared to what they are used too.  Tasted fine to me but the kids didn't like it at all.	0	0
-1	B003PFUNU4	A395DTRAZ07222	PRODUCT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED	Torani is a brand that sells their products in GLASS BOTTLES.  The product description here on Amazon.com of this package did not specify that the bottles are PLASTIC.  I would not have ordered this product had I known the bottles were plastic due to concerns about toxins in plastic.  I pay extra for Amazon Prime and expect to be able to return an UNOPENED ITEM if it is not what I thought it would be.  Not only will Amazon.com not allow me to return this item, they have deleted my prior feedback on the item.  Hopefully they will not delete this feedback too as it is VERY RELEVANT for customers in deciding which items to purchase.  If you don't want plastic bottles, do not order this set.	4	6

1	B000LKZ84C	APGQCBO10LZTH	Good product	I use this in place of mayo for many recipes when I need something creamy and quick.  This also works very nice for sweet dishes as there is very little taste to the tofu and it does absorb flavors well like a chocolate pie.	1	0
1	B008OV8RE8	A3HPCRD9RX351S	Worthwhile treats	"At first sniff the two girls turned up their noses at the new snack. To be fair, this happens with the introduction of most new snacks to this fussy and suspicious pair. By the third and fourth and subsequent offerings, the hesitation stopped. Though the girls genuinely like these treats now, there isn't the mad excitedness for them like they show for some others or for french fries.<br /><br />I like that the first ingredient of these snacks is  ""real""beef ( not the undesirable artificial beef),and they are made with natural ingredients. The treats are small and chewy and are good for training, rewarding, and bribing. For most dogs the consistency is probably perfect, just enough chew to add interest. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats in half so as not to tax the teeth she has left.<br /><br />Science Diet backs these treats with a 100% satisfaction guarantee."	1	0

I noticed that their affiliated deli sold LavAzza and I asked if that is what they brewed for the restaurant and was told yes.  I immediately went to Amazon and ordered and I am not sorry.

1	B001LG945O	A1NS6O584WD5FJ	Good alternative to regular orange soda	My daughter thinks this tastes like Sunkist Orange Soda, my grandson likes it and drank the rest of it (most of the can).  I thought it was okay (by I am not a fan of orange sodas); I would undoubtedly like it better in another flavor, like Grape, or Fruit Punch, or Kiwi Berry.<br />I think this is, of course, a much healthier alternative to any regular soda. And judging from my dautgher's and my grandson's experience with it, it would be hit with most kids.	0	0

1	B0028GY93S	AW9728SGLHR85	Healthier Dogs because of Earthborn!	This is the best dog food!  I have seven dogs, three over the age of 14 and they are as spry and energetic as dogs half their age.  We went grain-free years ago after one of our dogs got cancer.  I began reading about excess carbohydrates and how BAD they are for our dogs (and us)...Initially we used EVO because it was great and it was the only grain-free availble.  We were very happy with it until the price went through the roof!  We tried several different grain-free food over the next year or so.  Some the dogs just didn't like.  Some aggravated my Lhasa Apso's allergies.  A couple of my dogs are susceptible to yeast infections and the EVO had curtailed that problem but it came back with other foods.  Finally we tried Earthborn's Grain-Free line and VOILA!  They love it! The price is right, no allergies or infections...everyone is healthy and happy!This is the best food around and the price is right.	0	0
1	B002HQKRIK	A2IKWKIW5OS5CM	Koala Crisps rock!	We've been eating this delightful cereal for several years.  My kids always feel better on gluten free foods and so do I.  Unlike the popular junky cereals, this version of a slightly chocolately cereal is light and not too sugary and it's a special treat for the kids.  I also like supporting Envirokids products - the pricing has come down to where it's nearly the same as the other mainstream cereals that are not as good for you.	1	0

-1	B000UJW0W2	A12RXIGI4Z7U4A	Cheap Price - but save your money	"This mat is so small, and as others have noted, the ""turf"" is pointy - so it probably hurts cats' paws (it hurts my knees!)  My cat jumps right over it and I end up with litter kicked up all over the place.  Seems like a good concept, but I would bet it doesn't solve most people's problem of trying to contain the litter.<br /><br />I just bought an extra large Petmate Litter Catcher that has 4-1/2 stars.  Hopefully, I'll have more success with that!"	0	0
1	B003VXFK44	A3IR834T7AROBT	Pleasant, smooth and flavorful cup of coffee	"We have been enjoying our order of W.Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya dark roast coffee K-cups for the last week.  We find the delicious flavor very satisfying...not so strong to be bitter, and not so weak as to taste like colored water.  The coffee is perfect. There is just the right amount of heartiness to make it an enjoyable coffee experience, and it carries a nice lingering pleasant flavor and aroma.  It is not as strong as an espresso, but maybe one step below.  Like we said, ""pleasant, smooth, and flavorful!"""	3	0
-1	B000PDY3P0	A2I0ABGXLFUPL4	Not the best....	This is a tough popcorn. It's not bad just not the best. I have a popper that is a dome type with a wire sweeper that goes round and round. Most of the oil and salt stays in the bottom of the popper and never comes in contact with the corn kernels at the  bottom long enough to get on the popped corn. It is randomly spread and half of it is like air popped corn and tasteless.	0	1

Going to double my order on the next one I make, this one is so good.  It's the only one I've ever found that I made a second when I finished the first.

-1	B000ER6YO0	A2U138G3VKRZSL	Baby loves it, but there is plastic in it	This is my daughter's  most favorite baby food by far.  This is the only ones she'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds.  However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.<br />I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.  PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD? I notified Earth's Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing, but I am not giving my baby this food any more, even though she likes it, that's it for us.	0	1

After spending $20 a week on the stuff, I decided that I wanted to make it at my house sometimes to save a little money. The individual bags are the exact bags that the local shop uses.  I do prefer the consistency of the product when made by the shop, I think that has to do with my blender's age.  Overall, this product is super yummy!	0	0
-1	B0078Y6OX8	A19LUT6NUQZF3A	Don't waste your money!	Awful, Awful, Awful!  I like a lighter roast and I really love french vanilla so I was thrilled to find this one.  With the first sip I was highly disappointed.  It has a very strong artificial flavor that doesn't taste anything like french vanilla and it certainly doesn't taste like coffee.  Like one other reviewer said, I'll probably just toss it in the trash and throw that money away because I don't know anybody who would enjoy it.  YUK!	0	0
1	B0016FY6H6	APAOU9269HJRL	YUM....Yum, Yum!!!!	"This is just the quick iced tea fix I have been searching for.....it is perfectly balanced between the green tea and the natural, refreshing blueberry flavor. Keep in mind this is NOT sweet and sassy, like most instant tea ""add to bottled water"" packets. This is the real deal. If you want sweet, then order the sweet variety or add your favorite sweetener. When you add the powder, it is green....looks alittle weird, but once you can get past the looks, it's true love. I think it's delightful that I am actually consuming the entire leaf--finely ground to which it dissloves....thus making my water become murky, swamp water before my eyes!  That has to certainly be more bang for your buck for the level of antioxidants, opposed to the old brewing way.<br />  I have had a very difficult journey (until now) finding yummy, healthy (& QUICK) unsweetened flavored teas......my second favorite is the Celestial Seasonings COOL BREW bags....the blueberry green tea is also delicious, but not nearly as refined as this ""top shelf"" Stash.<br />I am pondering more flavors for my next order!"	1	0

1	B002GWMA08	AZ8H55VKA4MA3	Good price for a good coffee	I've drunk whole-bean Tanzanian peaberry for about 20 years.  My first source was the large national retailer and wholesaler Green Mountain, which roasted their Tanzanian peaberry light to medium.  Although the beans made good coffee, Green Mountain's price eventually became higher than I thought reasonable.  An internet seach led me to a small family-owned and family-operated roaster in Tennessee.  Their beans were also light to medium and, thus, had a dry appearance.  That level of roasting was to my liking because the beans retain more caffeine, and the natural flavor of the coffee is more apparent than with darker roasts.  When the Tennessee roaster's computer system crashed and online sales were temporarily suspended, I did another internet search and found Amazon's Tanzanian peaberry roasted by Coffee Bean Direct.  It has essentially the same good taste as the Tanzanian peaberry from the Tennessee roaster, and the price is lower.  I'm totally satisfied with the beans roasted by Coffee Bean Direct, and the shipping by Amazon is quick enough that buying three pounds at a time allows me to place my next order before the current one runs out.	0	0

1	B00068PCTU	A37QU23QG5SC48	The Only Sweetener I Will Use	NuNaturals Stevia is the only sweetener that I use in my beverages and cooking. I have tried other brands and this one is the best! It hasn't any odd taste, and tastes better than sugar to me. I buy the large 12 ounce container and it lasts me for months! I only wish they would put this in more products sold at the grocery stores. There is a soda that has stevia in it that I purchase at a health food store called Virgil's Zero and it comes in different flavors...it is great and I don't have to be concerned about the sugar content that is in traditional sodas. This product is great and I think is the best of stevia products on the market.	0	0
-1	B004R8J8E0	A3HUC8541SJ6UT	"Bland & Mushy - very ""School Lunch""ish"	I cook a lot, and I have a few ways of preparing pork chops that my teen boys like.  I picked up this Shake N Bake pouch with the hope that it could fill in on those really busy nights.  I didn't expect it to be as good as 'from scratch', but I expected it to be edible.<br /><br />If you were alive in the 70's, you know that Shake n Bake is a pre-made coating you put in a bag along with your meat.  As you may have guessed, you shake the bag, then bake your meat.  It's simple, and it's a low fat alternative to stovetop methods that need oil or butter. But the result is pretty pedestrian.  The coating doesn't crisp very well; it was downright mushy in spots, and the 'spices' in the mix were bland bland bland.<br /><br />Pork is already low fat and bland.  It needs a little bit of fat for flavor.  I don't fry any meat, but I do sautee my pork chops (coated with Panko & my own spices)in a splash of olive oil , which makes them moister, tastier, and crunchier.  To me, the baking just didn't work well.  Maybe if the SnB coating was actually, you know, flavorful, it would have helped.  But between the baking and the coating, the pork chops were bland and mushy.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  My hungry teen boys picked at them and asked to never have them again.	0	0
-1	B003TLMM44	A13PBH7213P60W	Skimps on chicken	These are the typical rawhides wrapped with chicken, and seem slightly higher quality than the kind you get at the dollar store.  But they really skimp on the chicken, so you it's mainly a rawhide twist with a shred of chicken on it.  My dogs go crazy when I give them one but their enthusiasm diminishes when the chicken's gone and with these treats, the chicken vanishes FAST (and my dogs are TINY). So they're great if your dogs loves rawhides and would enjoy the extra zip of chicken flavor but if your dog gets bored with plain rawhide, the joys of this treat will be over in a few seconds.  I'll be looking for a brand that delivers a meatier product.	2	0

-1	B001LGGH40	A2F1P10GGZ7K2T	Nothing new here. . .but it tastes good.	Sparkling juices aren't anything new and the Switch simply gives us more of the same. Whether you are drinking Welche's Sparking juice or an Izze, it comes down to flavor, nutrients and cost.<br /><br />Izze flavors are Apple, Pomegranate, Black Cherry, Grapefruit and Clementine.<br />Switch offers Orange, Watermelon, Kiwi-Berry (the flavor I tried), Black Cherry and Fruit punch.<br /><br />Also Izze gives you 10% of your daily allowance of Vitamin C, B6 and Niacin.<br />Switch gives you 100% of your daily vitamin C.<br /><br />Izze currently is $21.62 for 24 cans at 8.4 oz.<br />Switch is currently advertised at about a buck more for 24 cans at only 8.3oz cans.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />With Switch, you pay a similar cost to get more vitamin C and different flavors than offered by the main competitor.<br /><br />Could a vitamin supplement give you more of what you really need? Sure. But it's not nearly as fun as drinking any of these sparking juices.<br /><br />So if you need a more healthy alternative to soda, determine if cost, nutrients and/or flavor is your thing then try a Switch or an Izze.	1	0
1	B001VNGN0Q	A16CDO5H7BASS5	Acne medicine	I was reading a news story about how lab research suggest a thyme tincture to be one of the most effective ways to fight acne (better than a prescription).

I'm still letting it sit (it takes six weeks) before it will be complete. where I will then have to get cheese cloth and separate the thyme from the liquid and do a test run.

-1	B001LG945O	A2ULQOGN59LDNK	Not bad	Switch Orange Tangerine is ok but not what one might expect.  First of all, there is more apple and grape juice in here than orange or tangerine (this will not be a surprise if you are familiar with the other flavors as that is also true with them).<br /><br />Switch basically is carbonated juice.  The taste isn't a bad and it is supposed to be healthier than soda (which can be debated).  It is a reasonable drink for snacks but if you are going to need several if you are actually thirsty.	1	0

Perhaps the best pancakes I've ever had. We did make a couple modifications from the box recipe. Instead of using oil, we use the same amount of melted butter. And we add fresh blueberries to each pancake as it's cooking. Then, serve with whipped cream. So great! I'm looking forward to trying some of the other recipes with this, including pizza crust.	0	0

The nuts are a bit small, if you are used to larger varieties, but that is a small problem.<br /><br />I found they were not good for my feeding frenzies. Stuffing a whole box down in about 3 minutes is not a good idea, as the chocolate can leave a bit of an aftertaste in the throat. Taken at a more leisurely pace, they are a real treat.	1	0
1	B000B9SFP2	A2E3NAL9ECE7VS	Easy Setup, Nice Design	I haven't owned a portable fence for horses until now, but I am impressed and liking this product very much. Upon opening the package I was happy with the portability of the carrying bag, and shocked at how lightweight and compact this system is. It's a great accessory to throw in the trailer when taking the horses out, or just to have around in the event that we need a temporary corral for a couple horses. Once set up, it won't hold more than two of our horses comfortably. I don't think we'd ever try and manage to get 4 inside like the product advertises!<br /><br />The instructions were surprisingly simple and it set up easily between myself and my husband working on it. I can see how this would be great to have for other animals as well (such as alpacas), but we only have need for it with the horses and have had success in containing them.  The step in posts are fantastically designed, the overall design makes the fence very versatile, setting up easily pretty much anywhere your horse an go.<br /><br />We're very happy with it's design and portability and will get a lot of good use out of this system, I think!	0	0
1	B001RVFDOO	A1NIX2WA2ZKLV7	Not for everyone.. but I love it!	I'm sort of a health nut who has weened myself off highly-palatable junk food. Junk food is delicious but it ain't good for you. Conversely, healthy food has a bad rep for being disgusting but I honestly think that it's just something that requires training and acclimatization.<br /><br />I really like PopChips. They don't taste absolutely amazing to be honest but if you're someone who is trying to kick junk food out of your diet, this is a good way to fulfill a craving without succumbing to unhealthier junk foods. Each bag is only 100 calories, which is very helpful for portion control.<br /><br />For me, the taste is great. It's not amazing but it isn't awful. Sure there are better tasting chips out there but how much more unhealthier are they?<br /><br />I've tried small bags of PopChips from the vending machine (which I recommend doing before you buy a case). I haven't tried all over the flavors until I bought the case and I was a little disappointed with half of the flavors in the box. Fortunately, my boyfriend and I disagree on what tastes good so he likes the flavors I don't like and vice versa. It works out great for us and probably will work out great for family situations and parties where people usually don't have the tastes. However, if you plan on consuming these bags on your own over time I can almost guarantee that there will be a couple flavors that you won't like and it might just be worth it if you just buy a couple bags of flavors you do like.<br /><br />If you're not accustomed to the taste of 'healthy' food, you might not enjoy these at first. Either way, pop chips are worth a try. Probably not by the case though. i recommend trying out a few flavors if you can find a small bag at the shop or vending machine before you buy a big box of them.	0	0

My dogs LOVE the taste of this PB Stuff 'N Paste and I like and appreciate the convenience of being able to add PB to their Kongs with no mess whatsoever. That being said, I went through an entire can of this stuff way too fast. The label says it's concentrated and to use it sparingly, so I did. The problem is, if you have large dogs like I have, you will probably go through a can of this in less than two weeks. It's too expensive for me so I'm back to using real PB in their Kongs.	0	0

-1	B004ZIER34	A3NOBH42C7UI5M	Puroast Low Acid Coffee	The first thing I noticed, after brewing a pot of this coffee, was that it did not have the wonderful coffee smell that I love so much. When I first started drinking it, I didn't like the flavor, it is full bodies, but there was definitely something missing. By my second cup, it was starting to taste better, not bad actually. So I guess when you first start drinking this coffee you will notice it's not the same as the coffee you might be use to. But after you drink only this coffee, you get use to the flavor and it becomes a good alternative to regular coffee.	0	0

Drizzled on steak or chicken and as a topping for pasta and bruschetta with some garlic, parsley and parmesan cheese. Addictive so you'll want to have it in the house all the time.

The consistency is great -- it's not runny yet it's also not a solid hunk-a peanut butter with floating oil either.

-1	B008ZRKZSM	AIW77UMHDBGLU	Low fat, but it has sugar added so whats the point	I did not think PB2 tasted like true peanut butter, then I figure out why, it has sugar added. I guess for people who like sugar added to peanut butter will like it, but I do not like it. I don't get it take out 85% of the fat and add sugar. Why?? Hopefully waiting for them to take out the sugar.	5	1

-1	B002BCD2OG	A3IJP7JXMWEPB1	How this could be good?	I am very disappointed with this product because I could not see how many calories it has at the time I ordered it. I received it and now I can see it has 60 calories per tablespoon. Granulated sugar has only 45 calories per tablespoon. How could Agave Nectar be better than sugar?	1	7
-1	B005K4Q1VI	A3CAZVZTJ411SB	Not Good	"I read all the reviews on every hot chocolate k-cup on the market and decided to try this one first. Its not good. Even on the smallest cup setting it tastes watered down and there is a distinct ""plasticy"" taste. I think that this an inherent problem with all the k-cup hot chocolates. You just can't fit enough chocolate in the cup so that it doesn't taste watered down. I'm going to stick with making hot chocolate the old way."	0	1

1	B001LG945O	ABP2UMJY61K8A	Orange Soda Flavor with Real Fruit Juice	"If you love orange soda but don't want to drink soda this is the perfect product for you.  This taste just like orange soda but is actually made of 100% real fruit juice.  no joke.  It really tastes good.  I loved it.<br /><br />However just b/c you don't have all the ""fake"" soda ingredients it still has tons of calories for 8.3 ounces 140 to be exact.  A can of soda has 150 for 12 ounces so I am not sure what the trade off is unles you want 100% of your vitamin C!"	0	0
1	B003G5CUOU	A2ZYV16SKIF2C4	Great Tasting Crackers!	The crackers are very tasty and we just tried them out with a little salsa on top for a healthy low cal snack and my wife and I absolutely love'em. We will definitely get more once we run out!	0	0
-1	B00284TR82	APEFJ0GL9NS6X	Half crushed, rest covered in sticky mess	I was dissapointed to see this box when it arrived - right away you could tell from the wet box that the creamers had burst in transit.  Half of them were burst open, leaving the rest covered in a sticky mess.  I live in Colorado so perhaps it was due to the altitude in shipping but VERY dissapointing.  Worth the extra $$ to buy them at a local store so you know they are in good condition.	1	0
-1	B001EPPCFS	A3NITRYPR5E4VL	Great biscuits, lousy packaging	McVities digestive biscuits are great - not nearly as sweet as competitors. Biggest problem is how many are broken by the time they get to you. The Amazon packaging job does not hold up in shipping. This is true for all types of digestives I have received over the last couple of years from Amazon. Unfortunately they are the best source in the US. I wish they could think up a better packaging scenario for fragile items like this.	1	0
-1	B0078DQG00	A5H337PHOWR8S	Crumbled	I ordered these crackers because I've recently become allergic to wheat and have to eat gluten free.  These crackers arrived crumbled.  There were maybe 5 whole crackers in the entire box.	0	0
1	B001P737PC	A3UF4K552BJ1VC	100 calorie pop corn	We like Pop Secret 100 Calorie pop corn. The taste is good takes about one and a half minutes to pop and there is about 3 cups of popped corn. Pretty good snack and just 100 Calories. Good buy and price here on Amazon	0	0
1	B003QM6ZDU	A1D6O70C0CZUIE	I could drink this stuff!!	I bought this on a whim and wow do I consider myself lucky.  It was a shot in the dark, but this turned out to be one of the best hot sauces I have ever tasted.  Not only has some good spicy heat, but excellent flavor as well.  It's an unexpected mix of heat with a hint of sweet, and a very robust mix of spices.  One thing I really love about it is that it flavors whatever you put it on, but does not overwhelm it.  The heat is hot for sure, but doesn't linger for very long.  The flavor is very original.  I went back to Amazon and bought a whole case of it.	1	0
-1	B0032BXUJM	A35QDS2JR8942J	Nothing but problems	Just about 9 out of 10 of these would not work in my machine.  Its not my machine we have run hundreds of cups of coffee through it without an issue.  Had to toss most of them in the trash and clean up the mess they made.  They would just stop filtering about a third of the way then just pop and spill grinds everywhere!	0	0

"I Love all three products that Harmony Valley has but the Vegetarian Hamburger Mix is my familys favorite,we love to make Taco Salad, Sloppy Joes,Meatless Meatballs, Hamburgers,Salisbury Steak,Spaghetti with this great product , if you love the store bought Vegi burgers that are found in the frezzer section of your store these are 100 times better & so fresh tasting & GMO FREE !

1	B001HTI5I2	A10B89QOKDV5O3	Organic, simple, and fast!	My husband refuses to eat fish, but he LOVES this. It only takes 10-12 minutes to make, and is way better than any other kind of Tuna Helper I've tried.<br /><br />Besides the box itself, you'll need:<br /><br /> - 1 can of tuna (6 oz., or I use 8 oz.)<br /> - 1 tablespoon of butter<br /> - 1 cup of milk<br /><br />It's a breeze to prepare, just DON'T leave it alone before you put the tuna and pasta in. Because of the milk, it likes to boil over. Just keep an eye on it and reduce the heat right after it starts boiling.	0	0

1	B001EO5QW8	A2EB6OGOWCRU5H	Great Irish oatmeal for those in a hurry!	Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl. McCann's Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time. McCann's regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning. This is the best instant brand I've ever eaten, and a very close second to the non-instant variety.<br /><br />McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)	9	0
1	B000G6MBX2	A2D8K0GPVMMSER	yummy!	I Love these potato chip they r soooo good! =) sweet and spicy but not overwhelming just enough to work up the palate, not salty just enough to balance out the sweetness I will be ordering these again soon. LOVe IT!	0	0
1	B000N648QS	AVOJ0VK0G7MVN	My cats love Turducken!	"My cats are more enthusiastic about Turducken than just about any other cat food. They literally lick the plate clean. Even my LaPerm, who usually just gives me ""silent meows,"" manages to squeak out an audible meow when I start putting this on a plate.  The ingredients are much higher quality than many brands, too (no by-products, corn, etc.). I will be ordering more."	0	0
-1	B000TRFGGM	A2UR0VYXA2NL9N	Bad!!!	Two of the three plants were dying and are now dead. They all were tiny!!! They are suppose to catch flies but not one fly has been caught because they couldn't even fit in the bloom.  Rip Off!!! Do not do business with this vendor...	1	1
1	B003OP8L22	A3DD96LN8U1NM	Decent tasting	This coffee tastes pretty good, and I like the fact that it's organic (coffee has one of he highest rates of pesticides).  However, each time I use Subscribe & Save, unfortunately, the price seems to get raised substantially a few weeks later, which is why I had to cancel my subscription to this.	0	0
1	B000FBM4FI	A2K8QH6K647EZ2	Love these thin wafers!	I love rye. Used to eat the thick rye crisps, but my old teeth just can't handle them anymore.  But I still love some crunch. I also like to eat healthier and these crisp thins are whole grain and have more fiber than many bread options.<br /><br />It was getting harder to find them locally so I started getting them here on Amazon so I never have to be w/o my favorite cracker! Another bonus - I've had these around the house for years but my kids never showed any interest (just some weird thing mom ate) until I ordered a whole box of them last month. My last daughter still at home thought maybe she should try them since I bought so many. Now she's hooked so she's taking them off to college with her!	0	0
1	B001CGTN1I	A19MQQ1YD1YV4E	Great, but eat fast!	"These seeds are perfect for tossing into yogurt or smoothie.  But you must consume quickly.  The seeds draw moisture quickly causing them to swell.  You will be picking them from your teeth for days if you do not drink with a staw.  I have taken them straight from a spoon and washed them down with a glass of water before my ""light"" lunch and they really do give a feeling of fullness.  Do to a severe sensitivity to caffeine and any sort of stimulus, I wanted to try something natural that would not raise my pulse, quicken my MVP heart and just not make me overall jittery.  These do the trick.  When I drink a meal replacement drink, I still feel hollow inside and want to snack.  By adding a full, rounded table spoon of seeds after a few minutes, I feel nice and full.  These can be tossed into a powdered drink, a canned ready to go drink (milkshake type) and even into a vitamin water.  But believe me when I say, you must consume quickly or you will need a spoon, they turn into a jello consistency quick....which actually is not bad either.  You can bulk up a 100 calorie pudding snack by stirring in a teaspoon or so.  Many ways to get creative with the Chia seeds.  Enjoy!"	37	3
-1	B000SP1CWW	A38I2P244NDB5R	Not quite what I ordered...	I always buy the chicken flavor that walmart sells for around $6, so when I saw this BREATH one for about the same price, I was very happy (both of our large dogs love to get up close and personal!). However when it came, it was pepperoni flavor instead of fresh breath- the exact opposite!! :-O  However, the dogs still enjoyed it, although I won't order it online again since its a little bit cheaper at walmart- and I can be sure to get the right flavor!<br /><br />However, overall this Kong filler is awesome to keep our 2 large dogs entertained for a little while during the day- and they love it!	1	0
-1	B003YBJ9JA	A2SWVRWMDLGOHM	Too much sugar	My baby likes it but I think it's too much sugar. It's made from concentrate, so it tastes artificial. Try fruitables instead. It has vegetable and fruit juices, less sugar, and tastes much better. Good price on Amazon.	0	0
1	B000KFXEYE	A1SIXOS1U9WEJ3	Stephen's Gourmet Hot Cocoa, Cherry Chocolate, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)	"This is absolutely delicious.  Because it is in powder form, you can make it as strong or weak as your taste buds allow.  I add instant Folger's to mine, making it into a mocha.  That also cuts the sweetness.  It really DOES taste like chocolate covered cherries -- a treat I have loved since childhood!<br /><br />I get mine through the ""subscription program"" along with several other flavors from Stephen's.  The subscription program works well for me since I travel. You can change the frequency AND the address to which it is to be sent as needed."	1	0

1	B005K4Q1VI	A2H2Z1KG1YXMY1	Surprisingly Good!	We have tried many of the different hot cocoa k-cups...everything always tasted so watered down, even when using the smallest setting on the machine.  However, this brand...even at the medium cup setting, tasted fantastic.  I highly recommend Grove Square.  I haven't tried any of their other products, but I would be inclined to now based on this cocoa.	5	0
-1	B008FVVDG6	A22C6C63PKPMS6	Fake flavor	I was excited to try this because I love vanilla lattes. It is the drink I order most often, and make at home on a regular basis. This tastes so fake, similar to the instant vanilla coffee drinks. It does not taste like a vanilla latte that you can get at a coffeehouse.	0	0
1	B000G1X45G	A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q	The taste is as good as the aroma	I got a case of Yuban cans from Amazon for an amazing price and now that I've been reintroduced to Yuban I'm sticking with it.  It's Colombian which is the coffee I prefer anyway but Yuban  must have a special formula for roasting and grinding that results in such excellent coffee.  Cans have the foil seals that you can peel off so you don't need to use a can opener and of course plastic lids to reseal.  Sniffing this coffee as I scoop it into my coffee maker is half the delight!!  Just so excellent and suits my tastes perfectly.  Buying the case is very convenient too!!!!	6	1
-1	B002C69NSK	A2YQCYRNEW25ZM	Overpriced.	The bonsai itself is fine.  You cannot immediately tell it's artificial.  It just looks like a healthy little tree.  That being said, I have pretty much an exact identical from a set of three I also purchased online here.  I could have bought another set of three with the money I paid for this one.  The picture used makes it look like a larger bonsai and is clearly not the one you receive.  Live and learn.	0	1
-1	B006GCMI5Q	A1MQNS1QNI3YPK	It's just another form of Mrs. Dash	I was really looking forward to this salt substitute but it falls far short in my opinion. Tastes like a glorified version of Mrs. Dash and far from salt flavor. If you want something really good try Himalayan Pink Salt sold through Amazon --- it's outstanding !!!! I purchased the one with the grinder and it could not be better. Yum , real salt but good for you.	1	2
